law, democracy and public safety in our global society. Network science
provides invaluable tools to identify key players and design interventions for
Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), e.g., to dismantle their organisation.
However, poor data quality and the adaptiveness of criminal networks through
self-organization make effective disruption extremely challenging. Although
there exists a large body of work building and applying network scientific
tools to attack criminal networks, these work often implicitly assume that the
network measurements are accurate and complete. Moreover, there is thus far no
comprehensive understanding of the impacts of data quality on the downstream
effectiveness of interventions. This work investigates the relationship between
data quality and intervention effectiveness based on classical graph theoretic
and machine learning-based approaches. Decentralization emerges as a major
factor in network robustness, particularly under conditions of incomplete data,
which renders attack strategies largely ineffective. Moreover, the robustness
of centralized networks can be boosted using simple heuristics, making targeted
attack more infeasible. Consequently, we advocate for a more cautious
application of network science in disrupting criminal networks, the continuous
development of an interoperable intelligence ecosystem, and the creation of
novel network inference techniques to address data quality challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01508v2,physics.soc-ph

connectivity, efficiency, and safety. In Brazil, where road transport is a
significant portion of freight and passenger movement, network science can
provide valuable insights into the structural properties of the infrastructure,
thus helping decision makers responsible for proposing improvements to the
system. This paper models the federal road network as weighted networks, with
the intent to unveil its topological characteristics and identify key locations
(cities) that play important roles for the country through 75,000 kilometres of
roads. We start with a simple network to examine basic connectivity and
topology, where weights are the distance of the road segment. We then
incorporate other weights representing number of incidents, population, and
number of cities in-between each segment. We then focus on community detection
as a way to identify clusters of cities that form cohesive groups within a
network. Our findings aim to bring clarity to the overall structure of federal
roads in Brazil, thus providing actionable insights for improving
infrastructure planning and prioritising resources to enhance network
resilience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15865v1,physics.soc-ph

offering insights into their structures and enabling the quantification of
resilience and robustness. Understanding the underlying structures of
transportation networks is crucial for effective infrastructure planning and
maintenance. In military contexts, network science is valuable for analyzing
logistics networks, critical for the movement and supply of troops and
equipment. The U.S. Army's logistical success, particularly in the
""fort-to-port"" phase, relies heavily on the Strategic Highway Network
(STRAHNET) in the U.S., which is a system of public highways crucial for
military deployments. However, the shared nature of these networks with
civilian users introduces unique challenges, including vulnerabilities to
cyberattacks and physical sabotage, which is highlighted by the concept of
contested logistics. This paper proposes a method using network science and
geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the robustness and resilience of
transportation networks, specifically applied to military logistics. Our
findings indicate that while the STRAHNET is robust against targeted
disruptions, it is more resilient to random disruptions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11188v1,physics.soc-ph

implementation level has become an exciting area of quantum information
science. Although demonstrations of small-scale quantum networks have emerged
in the past decade, quantum communication and computation hardware remain
scarce resources today. As a result, the evaluation and validation of quantum
network protocols primarily rely on classical simulators rather than real
quantum networks. This paper introduces a novel quantum network simulation
method called control flow adaptation, which enhances standard tensor network
simulations. This method enables accurate and efficient simulations of many
important quantum network protocols by carefully leveraging the control flow
structures of them. Furthermore, we have developed a prototype quantum network
simulator, qns-3, as a module for ns-3. This new module implements the control
flow adaptation technique and applies it to a wide range of protocols. All
related code is open-sourced. We believe the development of the control flow
adaptation method and the qns-3 simulator represents a step forward in quantum
network research, offering a versatile and scalable platform for testing and
verifying quantum network protocols on classical computers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08956v1,quant-ph

friends than you do, on average. Recently, a stronger variant of the paradox
was shown to hold for most people within a network: `most of your friends have
more friends than you do.' Unlike the original paradox, which arises trivially
because a few very popular people appear in the social circles of many others
and skew their average friend popularity, the strong friendship paradox depends
on features of higher-order network structures. Similar to the original
paradox, the strong friendship paradox generalizes beyond popularity. When
individuals have traits, many will observe that most of their friends have more
of that trait than they do. This can lead to the Majority illusion, in which a
rare trait will appear highly prevalent within a network. Understanding how the
strong friendship paradox biases local observations within networks can inform
better measurements of network structure and our understanding of collective
phenomena in networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02061v1,cs.SI

accessible to all students regardless of their backgrounds. Despite
international education reforms focused on diversity, equity and inclusion many
teachers struggle to create inclusive science lessons. One reason may be, that
creating inclusive science lessons is challenging: it requires teachers to
balance the demands of science education with the diverse needs of their
students. Therefore, teachers need support in planning inclusive science
lessons. To address this issue, members of a German network for inclusive
science education (Netzwerk inklusiver naturwissenschaftlicher Unterricht,
NinU) have developed the NinU framework. This framework integrates perspectives
from both science education and inclusive pedagogy to support teachers in
planning and reflecting inclusive science lessons. Originally created as a
workshop resource for the NARST 2023 conference, this self-study manual
provides 1) an overview of the theory behind the NinU framework, 2) examples

pairwise correlation networks alone are insufficient for capturing the
high-order interactions that extend beyond pairwise interactions and play a
crucial role in brain network dynamics. These interactions often reveal
intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly
influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of
correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI
to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact
on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of
brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks
highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of
correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of
correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing
considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science.
Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of
correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs
predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the
visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role
in information integration within the human brain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00992v2,q-bio.NC

Antony Xavier', 'Eddith Sarah Varghese', 'Theertha Nair A.', 'Haidar Ali']","The modern era always looks into advancements in technology. Design and
topology of interconnection networks play a mutual role in development of
technology. Analysing the topological properties and characteristics of an
interconnection network is not an easy task. Graph theory helps in solving this
task analytically and efficiently through the use of numerical parameters known
as distance based topological descriptors. These descriptors have considerable
applications in various fields of computer science, chemistry, biology, etc.
This paper deals with the evaluation of topological descriptors for an
n-dimensional multistage interconnection network, the benes network,BB(n).
Also, a new variant of interconnection network is derived from the benes
network, named as augmented benes network and denoted as BB^* (n). The
topological descriptors for the benes derived network are also determined in
this work. Further, the benes network and augmented benes network undergoes a
comparative analysis based on few network parameters, which helps to understand
the efficiency of newly derived benes network. A broadcasting algorithm for the
augmented benes network is also provided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04135v1,cs.NI

dissipation in biological networks, most of which focus on the relationship of
dissipation and functionality. However, the development of networks science
urged us to fathom the systematic architecture of biological networks and their
evolutionary advantages. We found the dissipation of biological dissipative
networks is highly related to their structure. By interrogating these
well-adapted networks, we find that the energy producing module is relatively
isolated in all situations. We applied evolutionary simulation and analysis on
premature networks of classic dissipative networks, namely kinetic
proofreading, activator-inhibitor oscillator and two typical adaptative
response models. We found despite that selection was imposed merely on the
network function, the networks tended to decouple high energy molecules as
fuels from the functional module, to achieve higher overall dissipation during
the course of evolution. Furthermore, we find that decoupled fuel modules can
increase the robustness of the networks towards parameter or structure
perturbations. We provide theoretical analysis on the kinetic proofreading
networks and the general case of energy-driven networks. We find fuel
decoupling can guarantee higher dissipation and, in most cases when considering
dissipative networks, higher performance. We conclude that fuel decoupling is
an evolutionary outcome and bears benefits during evolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09447v1,physics.bio-ph

revealing the functional modules in complex systems as rooted in the wiring
architectures of complex networks. The varying procedures of community
detection can produce, however, divisions of a network into communities that
are prone to degeneracy given small changes to the network's configuration.
This yields network partitions of similar merit that are structurally
dissimilar, which is especially problematic when the network is constructed on
uncertain data. To reconcile with the ambiguity in interpreting degenerate
network partitions as representations of underlying system function, we
introduce a recursive significance clustering scheme that identifies the
subsets of nodes that have stable joint community assignments under network
perturbation. These robust node groups are referred to here as cores, and
represent well-supported features of the network. We show that cores
characterize the variability inherent to non-overlapping community structure in
weighted and directed networks and indicate robust community assignments that
are cohesive under temporal evolution of the network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12852v1,physics.soc-ph

investigate neural networks that map five key parameters in fire spread to the
first arrival time, and the corresponding inverse problem. By using simulated
data, we are able to characterize the error, the required dataset size, and the
convergence properties of these neural networks. For the inverse problem, we
quantify the network's sensitivity in estimating each of the key parameters.
The findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in fire science,

comprises 59,293 LLM-related papers, along with 70,945 machine learning (ML)
papers and 73,110 papers from non-LLM/ML fields as control groups. We first
employ Shannon Entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration. Our results
reveal that many fields have exhibited a more significant increasing trend

particular, Computer Science and Social Science display a consistent increase
in both institution and department entropy. Other fields such as Decision
Science, Psychology, and Health Professions have shown minor to significant

world experience a wave of democratic backsliding. Institutions of higher
education are often targets of autocrats who seek to suppress intellectual

global science grows larger and denser every year. This research analyzes the
effects of academic freedom on international research collaboration (IRC) in a

actor-oriented models (SAOM) are used to analyze the networks. The results show
positive significant estimates for both direct effects and homophily effects of
academic freedom on network evolution. These effects appear to increase in

patterns, tuned hosts and protocol stacks dedicated to large data transfers and
streamlined security postures that significantly improve data transfer
performance, accelerating scientific collaborations and discovery.
  Over the past decade, many universities and organizations have adopted this
model for their research computing. Despite becoming increasingly popular,
there is a lack of quantitative studies comparing such a specialized network to
conventional production networks regarding network characteristics and data

general-purpose campus network? Does it improve application performance
compared to such general-purpose networks? Through a two-year-long quantitative
network measurement study, we find that a Science DMZ exhibits lower latency,
higher throughput, and lower jitter behaviors. However, we also see several
non-intuitive results. For example, a DMZ may take a longer route to external

crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer
networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of
polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling
the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using
linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which
feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon
elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling
remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely
proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains.
We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network
elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing
tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this
strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our

about 1998, physicists discovered social networks as representations of complex

this Network Science. Relying on various models and mechanisms of
socio-cultural processes, an identity model is developed and calibrated in a
case study of Social Network Science. This research domain results from the
union of Social Network Analysis and Network Science. A unique dataset of
25,760 scholarly articles from one century of research (1916-2012) is created.
Clustering this set of publications, five subdomains are detected and analyzed
in terms of authorship, citation, and word usage structures and dynamics. The
scaling hypothesis of percolation theory is formulated for socio-cultural
systems, namely that power-law size distributions like Lotka's, Bradford's, and
Zipf's Law mean that the described identity resides at the phase transition
between the stability and change of meaning. In this case, it can be diagnosed
using bivariate scaling laws and Abbott's heuristic of fractal distinctions.
Identities are not dichotomies but dualities of social network and cultural
domain, micro and macro phenomena, as well as stability and change. Story sets
that give direction to research fluctuate less, are less distinctive, and more
inert than the individuals doing the research. Identities are scale-free. Six

science of science (SciSci), has become an important area of research in order
to address imminent questions including how scholars interact to advance
science, how disciplines are related and evolve, and how research impact can be
quantified and predicted. Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis
of citation networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been
employed: one is to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using
parametric distributions, and the other is to embed the citation networks in a
latent space optimal for characterizing the static relations between papers in
terms of their citations. Interestingly, citation networks are a prominent
example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e., networks for which each dyad
only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of citation). We presently
propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization of such
single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact
Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The \textsc{\modelabbrev} model
characterizes the scientific interactions in terms of a latent distance model
in which random effects account for citation heterogeneity while the
time-varying impact is characterized using existing parametric representations
for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight the proposed approach on several
real citation networks finding that the DISEE well reconciles static latent
distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic impact
assessments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00032v1,cs.SI

arise from their structure. For networked dynamical systems, structure is
typically quantified with network measures. A functional property that is of
theoretical and practical interest for oscillatory systems is the stability of
synchrony to localized perturbations. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
have been shown to predict this stability successfully; at the same time,
network measures have struggled to paint a clear picture. Here we collect 46
relevant network measures and find that no small subset can reliably predict
stability. The performance of GNNs can only be matched by combining all network
measures and nodewise machine learning. However, unlike GNNs, this approach
fails to extrapolate from network ensembles to several real power grid
topologies. This suggests that correlations of network measures and function

attention in the past two decades, and the corresponding network dynamics
theories have been continuously enriched with the advancement of network
science. Recently, time-varying feature and many-body interactions have been
discovered on various and numerous networks in real world like biological and
social systems, and the study of contemporary network science has gradually
moved away from the historically static network frameworks that are based on
pairwise interactions. We are aimed to propose a general and rudimentary
framework for Turing instability of reaction-diffusion processes on
higher-order temporal networks. Firstly, we define a brand Laplacian to depict
higher-order temporal diffusion behaviors on networks. Furthermore, the general
form of higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion systems with frequency of
oscillation is defined, and a time-independent and concise form is obtained by
equivalent substitution and method of averaging. Next, we discuss the two cases
of homogeneous and heterogeneous network systems and give the equivalent
conditions of Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Finally, in
the numerical simulation part, we verify and discuss the validity of the above
theoretical framework and study the effect of the frequency of oscillation of
higher-order temporal network on reaction-diffusion processes. Our study has
revealed that higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion, which takes into
account both time-varying feature and many-body interactions, can formulate
innovative and diversified patterns. Moreover, these are significantly
differences from patterns in continuous space and patterns on traditional

the topology structure of complex networks. Many methods have already been
proposed in the research on the structural analysis of complex networks to find
the different structural information of networks. In this work, the sum of
nodes' betweenness centrality (SBC) is used as a new structural index to check
how the structure of the complex networks changes in the process of the
network's growth. We build two four different processes of network growth to
check how the structure change will be manifested by the SBC. We find that when
the networks are under Barab\'asi-Albert rule, the value of SBC for each
network grows like a logarithmic function. However, when the rule that guides
the network's growth is the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi rule, the value of SBC will
converge to a fixed value. It means the rules that guide the network's growth
can be illustrated by the change of the SBC in the process of the network's

exhibit key patterns associated with social network principles including
preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and
the small-world phenomenon when forming networks. Moreover, LLMs adapt their
network formation strategies based on each network's characteristics,
reflecting the context-dependent nature of human behavior: in Facebook
networks, they prioritize triadic closure and homophily, mirroring close-knit
friendships; in phone networks, homophily and preferential attachment dominate,

constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support
the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game's Nash equilibria.
Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the

motif-based directed network comparison method that captures local, global, and

construct a motif distribution vector for each node, which captures the
information of a node's involvement in different directed motifs. Then, the

reinforcement learning to address two primary objectives: congestion control

However, accessing and using the riches of global knowledge can occur only

internationally and to tap into the global networked science is key. The
constantly evolving, bottom-up, autonomous, self-regulating, and self-focused
nature of global science requires deeper understanding; and the best way to
understand its dynamics is to understand what drives academic scientists in
their work. The idea that science remains a state-driven rather than
curiosity-driven is difficult to sustain. In empirical terms, we describe the
globalization of science using selected publication, collaboration, and
citation data from 2000-2020. The globalization of science implies two
different processes in two different system types: the growth of science in the
Western world is almost entirely attributable to internationally co-authored
publications; its growth in the developing world, in contrast, is driven by
both internationally co-authored and domestic publications. Global network
science opens incredible opportunities to new arrivals - countries as well as

distinct layers of edges. They are genuine representations for a large variety
of real systems whose elements interact in multiple fashions or flavors.
However, multiplex networks are not always simple to observe in the real world;
often, only partial information on the layer structure of the networks is
available, whereas the remaining information is in the form of aggregated,
single-layer networks. Recent works have proposed solutions to the problem of
reconstructing the hidden multiplexity of single-layer networks using tools
proper of network science. Here, we develop a machine learning framework that
takes advantage of graph embeddings, i.e., representations of networks in
geometric space. We validate the framework in systematic experiments aimed at
the reconstruction of synthetic and real-world multiplex networks, providing
evidence that our proposed framework not only accomplishes its intended task,
but often outperforms existing reconstruction techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12730v2,physics.soc-ph

visualizations as well as established network science techniques to gain
insights into the structure and interactions between users in citizen science

such as improved toughness and self-healing, when incorporated in polymer
networks for bioengineering and structural applications. In this work, we
performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to investigate the effect of the
energy landscape of reversible crosslinkers on the dynamic mechanical
properties of crosslinked polymer network hydrogels. We report that, for an
ideal network, the energy potential of the crosslinker interaction drives the
viscosity of the network, where a stronger potential results in a higher
viscosity. Additional topographical analyses reveal a mechanistic understanding
of the structural rearrangement of the network as it deforms and indicate that
as the number of defects increases in the network, the viscosity of the network
increases. As an important validation for the relationship between the energy
landscape of a crosslinker chemistry and the resulting dynamic mechanical
properties of a crosslinked ideal network hydrogel, this work enhances our
understanding of deformation mechanisms in polymer networks that cannot easily

iterative, developmental process periodically interrupted by innovations which
disrupt and restructure the status quo. Due to the immense societal value
created by these disruptive scientific and technological innovations,
accurately operationalizing this perspective into quantifiable terms represents
a key challenge for researchers seeking to understand the history and
mechanisms underlying scientific and technological progress. Researchers have
recently proposed a number of quantitative measures that seek to quantify the
extent to which works in science and technology are disruptive with respect to
their scientific context. While these disruption measures show promise in their
ability to quantify potentially disruptive works of science and technology,
their definitions are bespoke to the science of science and lack a broader
theoretical framework, obscuring their interrelationships and limiting their
adoption within broader network science paradigms. We propose a mathematical
framework for conceptualizing and measuring disruptive scientific contributions
within citation networks through the lens of network centrality, and formally
relate the CD Index disruption measure and its variants to betweenness
centrality. By reinterpreting disruption through the lens of centrality, we
unify a number of existing citation-based disruption measures while
simultaneously providing natural generalizations which enjoy empirical and
computational efficiencies. We validate these theoretical observations by
computing a variety of disruption measures on real citation data and find that
computing these centrality-based disruption measures over ego networks of

innovations relative to conventional disruption metrics which rely on local

to neural networks, the blow-up is only linear. We also analyze the delays in
running times due to the translations. In the translation from neural networks
to Boolean rules, the time delay is polylogarithmic in the neural network size
and linear in time. In the converse translation, the time delay is linear in
both factors. We also obtain translations between the rule-based logic for

alternative involves inferring a network from observed groups, for example,
inferring a network of scientific collaboration from researchers' observed
paper authorships. In this paper, I explore when an unobserved undirected
network of interest can accurately be inferred from observed groups. The
analysis uses simulations to experimentally manipulate the structure of the
unobserved network to be inferred, the number of groups observed, the extent to
which the observed groups correspond to cliques in the unobserved network, and
the method used to draw inferences. I find that when a small number of groups
are observed, an unobserved network can be accurately inferred using a simple
unweighted two-mode projection, provided that each group's membership closely
corresponds to a clique in the unobserved network. In contrast, when a large
number of groups are observed, an unobserved network can be accurately inferred
using a statistical backbone extraction model, even if the groups' memberships
are mostly random. These findings offer guidance for researchers seeking to

become a research focus in the field of network science. However, most of the
existing studies are focused on the networks with a single structure, e.g.,
community or bipartite, while ignoring multiple structures, e.g., the
coexistence of community and bipartite structures. Furthermore, existing
studies were faced with challenge regarding large-scale signed networks due to
their high time complexity, especially when determining the number of clusters

model. Moreover, by integrating the minimum message length (MML) criterion and
component-wise EM (CEM) algorithm, a scalable learning algorithm that has the

clustering coefficient and centrality measures (or node influence metrics),
affect the spread of viruses and the growth of epidemics over scale-free
networks. The results can be used to target individuals (the nodes in the
network) to \textit{flatten the infection curve}. This so-called flattening of
the infection curve is to reduce the health service costs and burden to the
authorities/governments. Our Monte-Carlo simulation results show that clustered
networks are, in general, easier to flatten the infection curve, i.e., with the
same connectivity and the same number of isolated individuals they result in
more flattened curves. Moreover, distance-based centrality measures, which

largest known data sets now including well over one billion individuals.
Interest in family history also supports an 8.5 billion dollar industry whose
size is projected to double within 7 years (FutureWise report HC1137). Yet
little mathematical attention has been paid to the complex network properties
of genealogical networks, especially at large scales.
  The structure of genealogical networks is of particular interest due to the
practice of forming unions, e.g. marriages, that are typically well outside
one's immediate family. In most other networks, including other social
networks, no equivalent restriction exists on the distance at which
relationships form. To study the effect this has on genealogical networks we
use persistent homology to identify and compare the structure of 101
genealogical and 31 other social networks. Specifically, we introduce the
notion of a network's persistence curve, which encodes the network's set of
persistence intervals. We find that the persistence curves of genealogical
networks have a distinct structure when compared to other social networks. This
difference in structure also extends to subnetworks of genealogical and social
networks suggesting that, even with incomplete data, persistent homology can be
used to meaningfully analyze genealogical networks. Here we also describe how
concepts from genealogical networks, such as common ancestor cycles, are
represented using persistent homology. We expect that persistent homology tools

examine networks of entities that are either adjacent or not adjacent.
Researchers have generalized such binary networks to incorporate edge weights,
which allow one to encode node--node interactions with heterogeneous
intensities or frequencies (e.g., in transportation networks, supply chains,

despite the fact that networks with complex weights arise in fields as diverse
as quantum information, quantum chemistry, electrodynamics, rheology, and
machine learning. Many of the standard network-science approaches in the study
of classical systems rely on the real-valued nature of edge weights, so it is
necessary to generalize them if one seeks to use them to analyze networks with

stratification along economic or other lines, with consequences for class
mobility and access to opportunities. With the rise in human interaction data
and extensive use of online social networks, the structure of social networks
(representing connections between individuals) can be used for measuring
stratification. However, although stratification has been studied extensively
in the social sciences, there is no single, generally applicable metric for
measuring the level of stratification in a network.
  In this work, we first propose the novel Stratification Assortativity (StA)
metric, which measures the extent to which a network is stratified into
different tiers. Then, we use the \texttt{StA} metric to perform an in-depth
analysis of the stratification of five co-authorship networks. We examine the
evolution of these networks over 50 years and show that these fields
demonstrate an increasing level of stratification over time, and,
correspondingly, the trajectory of a researcher's career is increasingly
correlated with her entry point into the network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01701v1,cs.SI

flight to connecting flights, leading to large disruptions in the overall
schedule. These disruptions cause massive economic losses, affect airlines'
reputations, waste passengers' time and money, and directly impact the
environment. This study adopts a network science approach for solving the delay
propagation problem by modeling and analyzing the flight schedules and
historical operational data of an airline. We aim to determine the most
disruptive airports, flights, flight-connections, and connection types in an
airline network. Disruptive elements are influential or critical entities in an
airline network. They are the elements that can either cause (airline
schedules) or have caused (historical data) the largest disturbances in the
network. An airline can improve its operations by avoiding delays caused by the
most disruptive elements. The proposed network science approach for disruptive
element analysis was validated using a case study of an operating airline. The
analysis indicates that potential disruptive elements in a schedule of an
airline are also actual disruptive elements in the historical data and they
should be considered to improve operations. The airline network exhibits
small-world effects and delays can propagate to any part of the network with a
minimum of four delayed flights. Finally, we observed that passenger
connections between flights are the most disruptive connection type. Therefore,
the proposed methodology provides a tool for airlines to build robust flight
schedules that reduce delays and propagation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08140v2,physics.soc-ph

data containing elusive topological changes. We propose two complementary
pixel-based visualizations, which reflect occurrences of selected sub-networks

network-level census (motif significance profiles) linked with a node-level
sub-network metric (graphlet degree vectors) views to reveal structural
changes, trends, states, and outliers. The network census captures
significantly occurring motifs compared to their expected occurrences in random
networks and exposes structural changes in a dynamic network. The sub-network
metrics display the local topological neighborhood of a node in a single
network belonging to the dynamic network. The linked pixel-based visualizations
allow exploring motifs in different-sized networks to analyze the changing
structures within and across dynamic networks, for instance, to visually
analyze the shape and rate of changes in the network topology. We describe the
identification of visual patterns, also considering different reordering
strategies to emphasize visual patterns. We demonstrate the approach's

response to dynamical perturbations. Recent studies recognize that many real

reactivity--the capacity of a linearly stable system to amplify its response to
perturbations, oftentimes exciting nonlinear instabilities. Here, we identify
network structural properties underlying the pervasiveness of nonnormality and
reactivity in real directed networks, which we establish using the most
extensive data set of such networks studied in this context to date. The
identified properties are imbalances between incoming and outgoing network
links and paths at each node. Based on this characterization, we develop a
theory that quantitatively predicts nonnormality and reactivity and explains
the observed pervasiveness. We suggest that these results can be used to

science community has lately given much attention to the so-called higher-order
networks, where group interactions are modeled alongside pairwise ones. While
degree distribution and clustering are the most important features of
traditional network structure, higher-order networks present two additional
fundamental properties that are barely addressed: the group size distribution
and overlaps. Here, I investigate the impact of these properties on the network
structure, focusing on cohesion and segregation (fragmentation and community
formation). For that, I create artificial higher-order networks with a version
of the configuration model that assigns degree to nodes and size to groups and
forms overlaps with a tuning parameter $p$. Counter-intuitively, the results
show that a high frequency of overlaps favors both network cohesion and
segregation -- the network becomes more modular and can even break into several

machine learning models on networks are deployed in high-stake domains.
Challenges arise as networks are often used across different domains (e.g.,
network science, physics, etc) and have complex structures. To facilitate the
communication between network dataset providers and consumers, we propose
network report. A network report is a structured description that summarizes
and contextualizes a network dataset. Network report extends the idea of
dataset reports (e.g., Datasheets for Datasets) from prior work with

Our controller has a fixed resource budget in each round and can use this to
minimize the effect of demand/supply shocks in the network. We formulate the
optimal intervention problem as a Markov Decision Process and show how we can
leverage the problem structure to efficiently compute optimal intervention
policies with continuous interventions and provide approximation algorithms for
discrete interventions. Going beyond financial networks, we argue that our
model captures dynamic network intervention in a much broader class of dynamic

proposed treatment in many areas of science, from medicine and healthcare to
the physical and biological sciences, from the social sciences to engineering,
to public policy and to the technology industry at large. Here, we consider
situations where classical methods for estimating the total treatment effect on
a target population are considerably biased due to confounding network effects,
i.e., the fact that the treatment of an individual may impact their neighbors'
outcomes, an issue referred to as network interference or as non-individualized
treatment response. A key challenge in these situations, is that the network is
often unknown, and difficult, or costly, to measure. In this paper, we
characterize the limitations in estimating the total treatment effect without
knowledge of the network that drives interference, assuming a potential
outcomes model with heterogeneous additive network effects. This model
encompasses a broad class of network interference sources, including spillover,
peer effects, and contagion. Within this framework, we show that, surprisingly,
given access to average historical baseline measurements prior to the
experiment, we can develop a simple estimator and efficient randomized design
that outputs an unbiased estimate with low variance. Our solution does not
require knowledge of the underlying network structure, and it comes with
statistical guarantees for a broad class of models. We believe our results are

transfers can introduce a degree of uncertainty in workflow operations, and the
associated lack of network information does not allow for either the workflow

after the inception of network science. However, many contemporary
presentations of this theory do not go beyond the original papers. Here we

derive simple formulas that capture the effect of common attack scenarios on
arbitrary (configuration model) networks. We hope that this gentle but

coupled on static networks. In reality, network connections are far more
dynamic. Connections among individuals receive feedback from nearby individuals
and make changes to better adapt to the world. Hence, it is reasonable to model
myriad real-world phenomena as co-evolutionary (or adaptive) networks. These
networks are used in different areas including telecommunication, neuroscience,
computer science, biochemistry, social science, as well as physics, where
Kuramoto-type networks have been widely used to model interaction among a set
of oscillators. In this paper, we propose a rigorous formulation for limits of
a sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto oscillators coupled on heterogeneous
co-evolutionary networks, which receive both positive and negative feedback
from the dynamics of the oscillators on the networks. We show under mild
conditions, the mean field limit (MFL) of the co-evolutionary network exists
and the sequence of co-evolutionary Kuramoto networks converges to this MFL.
Such MFL is described by solutions of a generalized Vlasov equation. We treat
the graph limits as signed graph measures, motivated by the recent work in
[Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349].
In comparison to the recently emerging works on MFLs of IPS coupled on
non-co-evolutionary networks (i.e., static networks or time-dependent networks
independent of the dynamics of the IPS), our work seems the first to rigorously
address the MFL of a co-evolutionary network model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01742v3,math.DS

multiple computer games and was even launched on Netflix in 2019, with the
latest season airing in December 2021. Fictional storylines such as The
Witcher, can be well summarized and simplified by network science, extracting
the backbone of a complex series of events. In other words, network mapping and
data science can transform thousands of pages into one simple, visual, social
map. This exemplary visualization also highlights the power of network science
by uncovering hidden patterns, such as influencers, hubs, and cliques in the
interplay of hundreds of people and their countless encounters. As these
methods can be applied to novels and their adaptations as well, they also allow
us to compare the original and the adapted pieces, from the cast to the plots.

Therefore, building a compact version of networks allowing their analyses is a
must. Backbone extraction techniques are among the leading solutions to reduce
network size while preserving its features. Coarse-graining merges similar
nodes to reduce the network size, while filter-based methods remove nodes or
edges according to a specific statistical property. Since community structure
is ubiquitous in real-world networks, preserving it in the backbone extraction
process is of prime interest. To this end, we propose a filter-based method.
The so-called ""modularity vitality backbone"" removes nodes with the lower
contribution to the network's modularity. Experimental results show that the
proposed strategy outperforms the ""overlapping nodes ego backbone"" and the
""overlapping nodes and hub backbone."" These two backbone extraction processes

mechanical properties of amorphous materials. Here, we study the elastic
behavior of under-constrained spring networks, i.e.\ networks with more degrees
of freedom than springs. While such networks are usually floppy, they can be
rigidified by applying external strain. Recently, an analytical formalism has
been developed to predict the mechanical network properties close to this
rigidity transition. Here we numerically show that these predictions apply to
many different classes of spring networks, including phantom triangular,
Delaunay, Voronoi, and honeycomb networks. The analytical predictions further
imply that the shear modulus $G$ scales linearly with isotropic stress $T$
close to the rigidity transition; however, this seems to be at odds with recent
numerical studies suggesting an exponent between $G$ and $T$ that is smaller
than one for some network classes. Using increased numerical precision and
shear stabilization, we demonstrate here that close to the transition linear
scaling, $G\sim T$, holds independent of the network class. Finally, we show
that our results are not or only weakly affected by finite-size effects,

understand the two observed phases, so we use another network structure (the so
called random geometric graph - RGG) together with other metrics borrowed from
network science. We observed a topological transition on the two associated
networks, which are subgraphs of the full network. As the links have two
possible states (friendly and non-friendly), we defined each associated network
as composed of only one type of link. The (non) friendly associated network has
(non) friendly links only. This topological transition was observed from the
domain distribution of each associated network between the two phases of the
system (absorbing and active). We also showed that another metric from network
science called modularity (or assortative coefficient) can also be used as
order parameter, giving the same phase diagram as the original order parameter

fundamental challenges at the interface of network science and logistics. Given
the multitude of performance criteria, real-world constraints, and external
influences acting upon such a system, even formulating an appropriate research
question to address this topic is non-trivial.
  Here we present an abstraction of a supply and distribution system leading to
a minimal model, which only retains stylized facts of the systemic function
and, in this way, allows us to investigate the generic properties of robust
supply networks. On this level of abstraction, a supply and distribution system
is the strategic use of transportation to eliminate mismatches between
production patterns (i.e., the amounts of goods produced at each production
site of a company) and demand patterns (i.e., the amount of goods consumed at
each location). When creating networks based on this paradigm and furthermore
requiring the robustness of the system with respect to the loss of
transportation routes (edge of the network) we see that robust networks are
built from specific sets of subgraphs, while vulnerable networks display a
markedly different subgraph composition.
  Our findings confirm a long-standing hypothesis in the field of network
science, namely, that network motifs -- statistically over-represented small
subgraphs -- are informative about the robust functioning of a network. Also,
our findings offer a blueprint for enhancing the robustness of real-world
supply and distribution systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02310v1,cs.SI

well-defined representation by building a model that captures an essential
aspect of the network system. Two current methods of representation are
available, one based on graph theory, where a network node is reduced to a

such as human heads, walls, towers or computer racks. In this paper, we adopt
an abstract representation methodology, the thinging machine (TM), proposed in
software engineering to model computer networks. TM defines a single coherent
network architecture and topology that is constituted from only five generic
actions with two types of arrows. Without loss of generality, this paper
applies TM to model the area of network monitoring in packet-mode transmission.
Complex network documents are difficult to maintain and are not guaranteed to
mirror actual situations. Network monitoring is constant monitoring for and
alerting of malfunctions, failures, stoppages or suspicious activities in a
network system. Current monitoring systems are built on ad hoc descriptions
that lack systemization. The TM model of monitoring presents a theoretical
foundation integrated with events and behavior descriptions. To investigate TM

comparison method based on network embedding, i.e., \textit{DeepWalk}, which
considers the global structural information. In detail, we calculate the
distance between nodes through the vector extracted by \textit{DeepWalk} and
quantify the network dissimilarity by spectral entropy based Jensen-Shannon
divergences of the distribution of the node distances. Experiments on both
synthetic and empirical data show that our method outperforms the baseline
methods and can distinguish networks perfectly by only using the global

exponent that collectively captures the changes of these observables.
Furthermore, for the scale-free network with a single initial size, we use its

vivid representations of relationships between variables. However, many of them

Refinement (NR) that adjusts the edge weights by applying a nonlinear graph

Specifically, this unified framework consists of two closely linked approaches

different perspectives: NR-F aims at enhancing signal strength, while NR-B aims
at weakening noise strength. Users can choose from which angle to improve the

math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,
low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly
diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed
studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples
well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and
subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a
pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of
students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly
with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'
well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These
patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating
math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network
science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening
upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data
science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as
complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.
graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional
associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not
only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math
anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of

policy lookup tables in systems such as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System
(ACAS). It is vital to ensure the safety of such neural controllers via
verification techniques. The problem of analyzing ACAS Xu networks has
motivated many successful neural network verifiers. These verifiers typically
analyze the internal computation of neural networks to decide whether a
property regarding the input/output holds. The intrinsic complexity of neural
network computation renders such verifiers slow to run and vulnerable to
floating-point error.
  This paper revisits the original problem of verifying ACAS Xu networks. The
networks take low-dimensional sensory inputs with training data provided by a
precomputed lookup table. We propose to prepend an input quantization layer to
the network. Quantization allows efficient verification via input state
enumeration, whose complexity is bounded by the size of the quantization space.
Quantization is equivalent to nearest-neighbor interpolation at run time, which
has been shown to provide acceptable accuracy for ACAS in simulation. Moreover,
our technique can deliver exact verification results immune to floating-point

has never seemed so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page
from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how
a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those
disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's set of current
beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the
interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially
important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science
modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated
cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in
empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model
that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal
cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a
public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which
begin opinion cascades. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model
with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and
institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that
population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has
been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model
dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs.
The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation
researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to
understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of
disinformation and ""alternative facts.""",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02828v2,cs.SI

2/3 (Arp2/3) on actomyosin networks using mechanochemical simulations of active
matter networks. At a nanoscale, the Arp2/3 complex alters the topology of
actomyosin by nucleating a daughter filament at an angle to a mother filament.
At a subcellular scale, they orchestrate the formation of branched actomyosin
network. Using a coarse-grained approach, we sought to understand how an
actomyosin network temporally and spatially reorganizes itself by varying the
concentration of the Arp2/3 complexes. Driven by the motor dynamics, the
network stalls at a high concentration of Arp2/3 and contracts at a low Arp2/3
concentration. At an intermediate Arp2/3 concentration, however, the actomyosin
network is formed by loosely connected clusters that may collapse suddenly when
driven by motors. This physical phenomenon is called an ""avalanche"" largely due
to the marginal instability inherent from the morphology of a branched
actomyosin network when the Arp2/3 complex is present. While embracing the data
science approaches, we unveiled the higher-order patterns in the branched
actomyosin networks and discovered a sudden change in the ""social"" network
topology of the actomyosin. This is a new type of avalanches in addition to the
two types of avalanches associated with a sudden change in the size or the
shape of the whole actomyosin network as shown in the previous investigation.
Our new finding promotes the importance of using network theory and machine
learning models to forecast avalanches in actomyosin networks. The mechanisms
of the Arp2/3 complexes in shaping the architecture of branched actomyosin
networks obtained in this paper will help us better understand the emergent
reorganization of the topology in dense actomyosin networks that are difficult
to detect in experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04005v2,q-bio.MN

diverges from the classical multi-layered hierarchical organization of the
traditional neural networks. At the same time, many conventional approaches in

the hierarchical organization of the networks, and recent works emphasize their
critical importance. This paper aims to connect the dots between the
traditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well

network organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is
proposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of
auxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the
node features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer
as well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous
learning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network

deeper understanding of the role of science in human society. While science is
heavily supported by public funding, common depictions suggest that scientific
research remains an isolated or 'ivory tower' activity, with weak connectivity
to public use, little relationship between the quality of research and its
public use, and little correspondence between the funding of science and its
public use. This paper introduces a measurement framework to examine public
good features of science, allowing us to study public uses of science, the
public funding of science, and how use and funding relate. Specifically, we
integrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all
scientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses
across three public domains - government documents, the news media, and
marketplace invention. We find that the public uses of science are extremely
diverse, with different public domains drawing distinctively across scientific
fields. Yet amidst these differences, we find key forms of alignment in the
interface between science and society. First, despite concerns that the public
does not engage high-quality science, we find universal alignment, in each
scientific field and public domain, between what the public consumes and what
is highly impactful within science. Second, despite myriad factors underpinning
the public funding of science, the resulting allocation across fields presents
a striking alignment with the field's collective public use. Overall, public

mesoscale structures in networks, and we illustrate our approach using several
synthetic network models and empirical friendship, collaboration, and
protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We find that these networks
possess a relatively small number of `latent motifs' that together can
successfully approximate most subgraphs of a network at a fixed mesoscale. We
use an algorithm for `network dictionary learning' (NDL), which combines a
network-sampling method and nonnegative matrix factorization, to learn the
latent motifs of a given network. The ability to encode a network using a set
of latent motifs has a wide variety of applications to network-analysis tasks,

internet data traffic. Hence, it is very important to reduce such network

research proposals are available in the literature which are applications of
data science and machine learning techniques. Most of the techniques rely on
significant amount of real time data collection. Network devices are assumed to
be equipped to collect data and these are then analysed by different algorithms
to predict failures. Every network element which is already deployed in the
field may not have these data gathering or analysis techniques designed into
them initially. However, such mechanisms become necessary later when they are
already deployed in the field. This paper proposes a Bayesian network based
failure prediction of network nodes, e.g., routers etc., using very basic

science and its applications. On the one hand, the concepts and analytical
methods, such as the emergence of the giant cluster, the finite-size scaling,
and the mean-field method, which are intimately related to the percolation
theory, are employed to quantify and solve some core problems of networks. On
the other hand, the insights into the percolation theory also facilitate the

percolation of strong heterogeneous systems, topological transition of networks

connections. So far, the percolation theory has already percolated into the

stable for all sufficiently small, positive edge costs. We uncover a rich
typology of stability:
  - we give an axiomatic approach to network centrality that allows us to
predict the stable network for a rich set of combination of centrality utility
functions, yielding stable networks with features reminiscent of structural
properties such as ""core periphery"" and ""rich club"" networks.

been inferred or reconstructed from non-network data---in particular, using
time series data from the nodes in a system to infer likely connections between
them. Selecting the most appropriate technique for this task is a challenging
problem in network science. Different reconstruction techniques usually have
different assumptions, and their performance varies from system to system in
the real world. One way around this problem could be to use several different
reconstruction techniques and compare the resulting networks. However, network
comparison is also not an easy problem, as it is not obvious how best to

little is known about the manner in which scientific and technological

measuring the structure and dynamics of knowledge. While helpful, existing
approaches struggle to capture the global properties of the underlying
networks, leading to conflicting observations about the nature of scientific

algebraic topology to characterize the higher-order structure of knowledge
networks in science and technology across scale. We observe rapid growth in the
higher-order structure of knowledge in many scientific and technological
fields. This growth is not observable using traditional network measures. We
further demonstrate that the emergence of higher-order structure coincides with
decline in lower-order structure, and has historically far outpaced the
corresponding emergence of higher-order structure in scientific and
technological collaboration networks. Up to a point, increases in higher-order
structure are associated with better outcomes, as measured by the novelty and

comprehensive, customizable quantum network simulator. Our simulator consists
of five modules: Hardware models, Entanglement Management protocols, Resource
Management, Network Management, and Application. This framework is suitable for
simulation of quantum network prototypes that capture the breadth of current

suite of network protocols and demonstrate the use of SeQUeNCe by simulating a
photonic quantum network with nine routers equipped with quantum memories. The
simulation capabilities are illustrated in three use cases. We show the
dependence of quantum network throughput on several key hardware parameters and
study the impact of classical control message latency. We also investigate
quantum memory usage efficiency in routers and demonstrate that redistributing
memory according to anticipated load increases network capacity by 69.1% and
throughput by 6.8%. We design SeQUeNCe to enable comparisons of alternative

has been demonstrated a wide range of applications to real-world networks

topological characteristics, such as the small-world phenomenon,
small-diameter, scale-free properties, or fat-tailed degree distribution were
one of the underlying pillars fostering the study of complex networks. Relating
these phenomena with other emergent properties in complex systems became a
subject of central importance. By introducing new implications on the interface
between data science and complex systems science with the purpose of tackling
some of these issues, in this article we present a model for a network game

compressibility of graph representations have been played an important role in

universal algorithmic methods based on algorithmic information theory applied
to graphs cannot be straightforwardly imported into the multidimensional case.
In this direction, as a worst-case scenario of lossless compressibility
distortion that increases linearly with the number of distinct dimensions, this
article presents a counter-intuitive phenomenon that occurs when dealing with
networks within non-uniform and sufficiently large multidimensional spaces. In

Specifically, we develop a dynamic variant of diffusion convolutional recurrent
neural networks to forecast traffic in research WANs. We evaluate the efficacy
of our approach on real traffic from ESnet, the U.S. Department of Energy's

network equilibrium models are revisited through graph-theory laws and
attributes with special focus on systems that can sustain equilibrium in the
absence of external perturbations (self-equilibrium). A new approach for the
analysis of self-equilibrated networks is proposed; they are modeled as a
collection of cells, predefined elementary network units that have been
mathematically shown to compose any self-equilibrated network. Consequently,
the equilibrium state of complex self-equilibrated systems can be obtained
through the study of individual cell equilibria and their interactions. A

is inaccessible to researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce here
a network generator for synthetic networks that are statistically similar to a
real network but void of personal information about its members. The generator
uses statistical data about a real or imagined covert organization network. It
generates randomized instances of the Stochastic Block model of the network
groups but preserves this network organizational structure. The direct use of
such anonymized networks is for training on them the research and analytical
tools for finding structure and dynamics of covert networks. Since these
synthetic networks differ in their sets of edges and communities, they can be
used as a new source for network analytics. First, they provide alternative
interpretations of the data about the original network. The distribution of
probabilities for these alternative interpretations enables new network
analytics. The analysts can find community structures which are frequent,

classified hierarchically into categories, with different priorities to attack.
The category of critical edges (or nodes) has the highest priority to be
selected for attack. Extensive experiments on nine synthetic networks and nine
real-world networks show the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical attack
strategies for destructing the network controllability. From the protection
point of view, this study suggests that the critical edges and nodes should be

use of random networks, including the introduction of two planar random
networks that are useful for spatial network simulation research, and a
real-world case study from urban planning and public health. We observe
significant variation between nodal characteristics and optimal connections

recent success of deep learning techniques on graph-structured data suggests a
new way to model the non-linear cross-modality relationship. However, current
deep brain network methods either ignore the intrinsic graph topology or
require a network basis shared within a group. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel end-to-end deep graph representation learning (Deep Multimodal
Brain Networks - DMBN) to fuse multimodal brain networks. Specifically, we
decipher the cross-modality relationship through a graph encoding and decoding
process. The higher-order network mappings from brain structural networks to
functional networks are learned in the node domain. The learned network

on a popular protein-protein interaction network dataset, using four different
evaluation metrics, we achieve (i) the most accurate alignments, (ii) increased
robustness against noise, and (iii) superior scaling capacity. The EDNA
algorithm is versatile in that other available network alignments/embeddings

conclusion, EDNA outperforms state-of-the-art methods for network alignment,

subsequent tasks regarding the nodes and/or edges of the network, such as
community detection, node classification and link prediction. Network embedding

different settings, often dependent of the downstream tasks. As a result, it is
challenging to study these algorithms in the literature systematically.
Motivated by the recently proposed Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework, we

encodes the ordering and causality of interactions between nodes and has a
profound effect on network dynamics and function. Empirical evidences have
shown that the temporal nature of links in many real-world networks is not

considering the entanglement between topological and temporal link patterns.
Here we propose an entropy-rate based framework, based on combined
topological-temporal regularities, for quantifying the predictability of any
temporal network. We apply our framework on various model networks,
demonstrating that it indeed captures the intrinsic topological-temporal
regularities whereas previous methods considered only temporal aspects. We also
apply our framework on 18 real networks of different types and determine their
predictability. Interestingly, we find that for most real temporal networks,
despite the greater complexity of predictability brought by the increase in
dimension the combined topological-temporal predictability is higher than the
temporal predictability. Our results demonstrate the necessity of incorporating

methods. The first one is a shallow method named RSDNE. Specifically, to
benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RSDNE guarantees both
intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity in an approximate way. The
other method is RECT which is a new class of graph neural networks. Different

connectivity-informed method that converts the drainage network images to the
directional information of flow on each node of the drainage network, and then
transform it into multiple binary layers where the connectivity constraints
between nodes in the drainage network are stored. DCGANs trained with three
different types of training samples were compared; 1) original drainage network

they pose as a perfect example of how single elements of a system give rise to
collective phenomena on an intricate, non-trivial structure of interactions.
However, co-authorship networks are, in fact, one-mode projections of original
bipartite networks, which we call here scientific networks, where authors are
agents connected to artifacts - the papers they have published. Nonetheless,
few studies take into account the structure of the original bipartite network

Here, we create bipartite networks using extensive datasets from the American
Physical Society (APS) dating back to 1893 up to 2015 inclusive, and from arXiv

structure of scientific networks considering four major features of bipartite
networks, namely degree distributions, density, redundancy and cycles. We show
how such features shape the formation of co-authorship networks and their
observed structural properties. While the structure of the networks of most
disciplines does not show significant changes over time, the appearance of
large collaborations, in physics, generate largely skewed degree distributions
of top nodes. The latter, in turn, induces massive cliques in the projection,

applied to networks as they are designed only for high-dimensional data
analysis. To address this problem, we introduce a new analysis approach called
contrastive network representation learning (cNRL). By integrating two machine

cNRL enables embedding of network nodes into a low-dimensional representation
that reveals the uniqueness of one network compared to another. Within this

provide learning bounds for analytic functions on the sphere for any kernel
method or equivalent infinitely-wide network with the corresponding activation
function trained with SGD. We show that a wide, one-hidden layer ReLU network
can learn analytic functions with a number of samples proportional to the
derivative of a related function. Many functions important in the sciences are
therefore efficiently learnable. As an example, we prove explicit bounds on
learning the many-body gravitational force function given by Newton's law of
gravitation. Our theoretical bounds suggest that very wide ReLU networks (and
the corresponding NTK kernel) are better at learning analytic functions as
compared to kernel learning with Gaussian kernels. We present experimental
evidence that the many-body gravitational force function is easier to learn
with ReLU networks as compared to networks with exponential activations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07724v1,cs.LG

analysis, recommender systems, and epidemiology. Representing complex networks
as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only
structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature
stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is
challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a
lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range
of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification.
Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of
dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks
for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that
this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural
networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the
ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of
dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation. Second, we
present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the
proposed terminology",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07496v2,cs.SI

network architecture and theoretical and practical innovations necessary for
future networks. Network architecture in this context refers to the structure
of a computer network system as well as interactions among its physical
components, their configuration, and communication protocols. Various
descriptions of architecture have been developed over the years with an
unusually large number of superficial icons and symbols. This situation has
created a need for more coherent systematic representations of network
architecture. This paper is intended to refine the design, analysis, and
documentation of network architecture by adopting a conceptual model called a
thinging (abstract) machine (TM), which views all components of a network in
terms of a single notion: the flow of things in a TM. Since cloud computing has
become increasingly popular in the last few years as a model for a shared pool
of networks, servers, storage, and applications, we apply the TM to model a
real case study of cloud networks. The resultant model introduces an integrated

view the network as an opaque infrastructure into which they inject data and
hope that it emerges at the destination with an acceptable Quality of
Experience. There is little ability for applications to interact with the

expected performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in
real time. The work presented here is motivated by a vision for a new smart
network and smart application ecosystem that will provide a more deterministic
and interactive environment for domain science workflows. The Software-Defined
Network for End-to-end Networked Science at Exascale (SENSE) system includes a
model-based architecture, implementation, and deployment which enables
automated end-to-end network service instantiation across administrative
domains. An intent based interface allows applications to express their
high-level service requirements, an intelligent orchestrator and resource
control systems allow for custom tailoring of scalability and real-time
responsiveness based on individual application and infrastructure operator
requirements. This allows the science applications to manage the network as a
first-class schedulable resource as is the current practice for instruments,
compute, and storage systems. Deployment and experiments on production networks
and testbeds have validated SENSE functions and performance. Emulation based
testing verified the scalability needed to support research and education
infrastructures. Key contributions of this work include an architecture

temporal, and adaptive patterns of interactions, its intuitive and flexible
nature has contributed to the popularity of the field. With pioneering work on
the evolution of random graphs, graph theory is often cited as the mathematical
foundation of network science. Despite this narrative, the two research
communities are still largely disconnected. In this Commentary we discuss the
need for further cross-pollination between fields -- bridging the gap between

Such networks were then referred to as scale-free. However, due to a lack of a

leading to confusion and contradictory claims regarding scale-freeness of a
given network. Recognizing this problem, the authors of ""Scale-free networks

Models and algorithms for such networks are pervasive in our society, and
impact human behavior via social networks, search engines, and recommender
systems to name a few. A widely used algorithmic technique for modeling such
complex networks is to construct a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the
vertices of the network, where proximity of vertices is interpreted as the
likelihood of an edge. Contrary to the common view, we argue that such graph
embeddings do not}capture salient properties of complex networks. The two
properties we focus on are low degree and large clustering coefficients, which
have been widely established to be empirically true for real-world networks. We
mathematically prove that any embedding (that uses dot products to measure
similarity) that can successfully create these two properties must have rank
nearly linear in the number of vertices. Among other implications, this
establishes that popular embedding techniques such as Singular Value
Decomposition and node2vec fail to capture significant structural aspects of

pass as a link in football games. Thus, we can analyze the networks by using
tools developed in network science. Among various metrics characterizing a
network, centrality metrics have often been used to identify key players in a
passing network. However, a tolerance to players being marked or passes being
blocked in a passing network, namely the robustness of the network, has been
poorly understood so far. Because the robustness of a passing network can be
connected to the increase of ball possession, it would be deeply related to the
outcome of a game. Here, we developed position-dependent passing networks of 45
matches by 18 teams belonging to the Japan Professional Football League. Then,
nodes or links were continuously removed from the passing networks by two
removal methods so that we could evaluate the robustness of these networks
against the removals. The results show that these passing networks commonly
contain hubs (key players making passes). Then, we analyzed the most robust
networks in detail and found that their full backs increase the robustness by
often invoking a heavier emphasis on attack. Moreover, we showed that the
robustness of the passing networks and the team performance have a positive
correlation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13465v2,physics.soc-ph

this work, we explore whether existing network growth models can realize the

node-centric property observed recently in citation networks across multiple
domains of research. We theoretically and empirically show that the network
growth models which are solely based on degree and/or intrinsic fitness cannot
realize certain temporal growth behaviors that are observed in real-world
citation networks. To this end, we propose two new growth models that localize

understanding the structured nature of social life, including for social
network data. However, the application of statistical network models within
large-scale community research is hindered by too little understanding of the
validity of their inferences under realistic data collection conditions,
including sampled or missing network data. The autologistic actor attribute
model (ALAAM) is a statistical model based on the well-established exponential
random graph model (ERGM) for social networks. ALAAMs can be regarded as a
social influence model, predicting an individual-level outcome based on the
actor's network ties, concurrent outcomes of his/her network partners, and
attributes of the actor and his/her network partners. In particular, an ALAAM
can be used to measure contagion effects, that is, the propensity of two actors
connected by a social network tie to both have the same value of an attribute.
We investigate the effect of using simple random samples and snowball samples
of network data on ALAAM parameter inference, and find that parameter inference
can still work well even with a nontrivial fraction of missing nodes. However
it is safer to take a snowball sample of the network and estimate conditional
on the snowball sampling structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00849v2,cs.SI

that can seriously affect social activities in the real world because the

faculties. Therefore, a deeper understanding of user dynamics in online social

the effective user dynamics models is the networked oscillation model; it uses
a second-order differential equation with Laplacian matrix. Although our
previous study indicates that the oscillation model provides us with a minimal
but effective model of user interactions, there still remains the open problem
as to the existence of a first-order fundamental differential equation that
respects the structure of the original network. This paper fills in this gap

study the emergence of network motifs in multi-layer perceptrons, whose initial
connectivity is defined as a stack of fully-connected, bipartite graphs. Our
simulations show that the final network topology is primarily shaped by
learning dynamics, but can be strongly biased by choosing appropriate weight

differences between either node or edge measurements or correlations without
considering the topology of networks such as the connected components or holes.
In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning based methods have become
popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent homology

topological features of data that persist across multiple scales with
applications ranging from biological networks to social networks. In this

them cannot still been developed. However, earthquakes are tried to be
predicted through numerous methods. One of these methods, artificial neural
networks give appropriate outputs to different patterns by learning the
relationship between the determined inputs and outputs. In this study, a
feedforward back propagation artificial neural network that is connected to
Gutenberg-Richter relationship and that bases on b value used in earthquake
predictions was developed. The artificial neural network was trained employing
earthquake data belonging to four different regions which have intensive
seismic activity in the west of Turkey. After the training process, the
earthquake data belonging to later dates of the same regions were used for
testing and the performance of the network was put forward. When the prediction
results of the developed network are examined, the prediction results that the
network predicts that an earthquake is not going to occur are quite high in all
regions. Furthermore, the earthquake prediction results that the network
predicts that an earthquake is going to occur are different to some extent for
the studied regions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02209v1,cs.OH

allows to build random networks having pre-assigned degree distribution and
two-point correlations. For the case of scale-free degree distributions, we
discretize the tail of the distribution according to the general prescription
by Dorogovtsev and Mendes. The application of this method to Barabasi-Albert
(BA) networks is possible thanks to recent analytical results on their
correlations, and allows to compare the ensemble of random networks generated
in the configuration model with that of ""real"" networks obtained from
preferential attachment. For $\beta\ge 2$ ($\beta$ is the number of parent
nodes in the preferential attachment scheme) the networks obtained with the
configuration model are completely connected (giant component equal to 100%).
In both generation schemes a clear disassortativity of the small degree nodes
is demonstrated from the computation of the function $k_{nn}$. We also develop
an efficient rewiring method which produces tunable variations of the
assortativity coefficient $r$, and we use it to obtain maximally disassortative
networks having the same degree distribution of BA networks with given $\beta$.
Possible applications of this method concern assortative social networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08093v1,physics.soc-ph

incompressible high-order networks defined by a generalized graph

half of the network size within a strong-asymptotically dominated standard
deviation, and rigidity with respect to automorphisms. In addition, we
demonstrate that incompressible dynamic (or dynamic multilayered) networks have

science and mathematics have focused on how to contain the outbreaks of
Internet misinformation that threaten social systems and undermine societal
health. Most research on this topic treats the connections among individuals as
static, but these connections change in time, and thus social networks are also
temporal networks. Currently there is no theoretical approach to the problem of
containing misinformation outbreaks in temporal networks. We thus propose a
misinformation spreading model for temporal networks and describe it using a
new theoretical approach. We propose a heuristic-containing (HC) strategy based
on optimizing final outbreak size that outperforms simplified strategies such
as those that are random-containing (RC) and targeted-containing (TC). We
verify the effectiveness of our HC strategy on both artificial and real-world
networks by performing extensive numerical simulations and theoretical
analyses. We find that the HC strategy greatly increases the outbreak threshold

issue for study. Yet, with the modern web technologies today, the traditional
social communication topologies have evolved from node-central structures to
online cycle-based communities, urgently requiring new network theories and
tools. Switching the focus from node degrees to network cycles, it could reveal
many interesting properties from the perspective of totally homogeneous
networks, or sub-networks in a complex network, especially basic simplexes
(cliques) such as links and triangles. Clearly, comparing to node degrees it is
much more challenging to deal with network cycles. For studying the latter, a
new clique vector space framework is introduced in this paper, where the vector
space with a basis consisting of links has the dimension equal to the number of
links, that with a basis consisting of triangles has the dimension equal to the
number of triangles, and so on. These two vector spaces are related through a
boundary operator, e.g., mapping the boundary of a triangle in one space to the
sun of three links in the other space. Under the new framework, some important
concepts and methodologies from algebraic topology, such as characteristic
number, homology group and Betti number, will have a play in network science

hypothesise that there is an irreducible uncertainty in link prediction on real
networks as a consequence of the random nature of their formation process. By
considering ensembles defined by well-known network models, we prove
analytically that even the best possible link prediction method for an
ensemble, given by the ranking of the ensemble connection probabilities, yields
a limited precision. This result suggests a theoretical limitation to the
predictability of links in real complex networks. Finally, we show that
connection probabilities inferred by fitting network models to real networks
allow to estimate an upper-bound to the predictability of missing links, and we
further propose a method to approximate such bound from incomplete instances of

different problems namely network metrics, models, visualization and
information spreading, each one with several approaches, methods and

calculation of different centrality measures (i.e.: the most important vertices
within a graph). Today, the challenge is how to do this fast and efficiently,
as many increasingly larger datasets are available. Recently, the need to apply
such centrality algorithms to non static networks (i.e.: networks that evolve
over time) is also a new challenge. Incremental and dynamic versions of
centrality measures are starting to emerge (betweenness, closeness, etc). Our
contribution is the proposal of two incremental versions of the Laplacian
Centrality measure, that can be applied not only to large graphs but also to,
weighted or unweighted, dynamically changing networks. The experimental
evaluation was performed with several tests in different types of evolving

performance linked to network position along two complimentary dimensions:
performance expected due to network position and performance relative to this

position through their distribution of distances to other authors. The s-index
then ranks (1) the citation potential of an individual's network position
relative to all other authors, and (2) the citations they accrue relative to
authors that have a comparable network position. Characterizing scientists
through these two complimentary dimensions can be used to make more informed

necessary for the further development of theories explicating circuit function.
Perhaps as a derivative of its initial application to abstract informational
systems, network science provides many methods and summary statistics that
address the network's topological characteristics with little or no thought to
its physical instantiation. Recent progress has capitalized on quantitative
tools from network science to parsimoniously describe and predict neural
activity and connectivity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet, for
embedded systems, physical laws can directly constrain processes of network
growth, development, and function, and an appreciation of those physical laws
is therefore critical to an understanding of the system. Recent evidence
demonstrates that the constraints imposed by the physical shape of the brain,
and by the mechanical forces at play in its development, have marked effects on
the observed network topology and function. Here, we review the rules imposed
by space on the development of neural networks and show that these rules give
rise to a specific set of complex topologies. We present evidence that these
fundamental wiring rules affect the repertoire of neural dynamics that can
emerge from the system, and thereby inform our understanding of network
dysfunction in disease. We also discuss several computational tools,
mathematical models, and algorithms that have proven useful in delineating the
effects of spatial embedding on a given networked system and are important
considerations for addressing future problems in network neuroscience. Finally,
we outline several open questions regarding the network architectures that
support circuit function, the answers to which will require a thorough and

relationships between a set of agents; however, little focus has been given to
the considerations of how to represent observed phenomena as a network object.
In the case of physical structures such as electric grids or transportation
flows, the construction of a network model is fairly straightforward as the
nodes and edges usually correspond to some physical structure themselves. On
the other hand, construction of a social network is much less defined; while
nodes may correspond to well defined social agents, such as people or groups of
people, there much more liberty in defining the relationship that edges should
represent. This paper studies the intricacies of constructing a social network
from data, in particular, binary data, applicable to a wide range of social
science contexts. We examine several methods of constructing social networks in
prior literature and discuss the methods under a common framework. Finally,
using a data set of meetings among technologists in New York, we show that the
different constructions of social networks arising from various interpretations

myriad applications throughout the sciences, engineering, and even the
humanities. To understand large-scale structure in a network, a common task is
to cluster a network's nodes into sets called ""communities"", such that there
are dense connections within communities but sparse connections between them. A
popular and statistically principled method to perform such clustering is to
use a family of generative models known as stochastic block models (SBMs). In
this paper, we show that maximum likelihood estimation in an SBM is a network
analog of a well-known continuum surface-tension problem that arises from an
application in metallurgy. To illustrate the utility of this relationship, we
implement network analogs of three surface-tension algorithms, with which we

last few years as one of the key features of cloud computing. Network
virtualization allows multiple virtual networks to share physical resources of
single substrate network. However, sharing substrate network resources
increases impact of single substrate resource failure. One of the commonly
applied mechanisms to protect against such failures is provisioning redundant
substrate resources for each virtual network to be used to recover affected
virtual resources. However, redundant resources decreases cloud revenue by
increasing virtual network embedding cost. In this paper, a collective
neurodynamic approach has been proposed to reduce amount of provisioned
redundant resources and reduce cost of embedding virtual networks. The proposed
approach has been evaluated by using simulation and compared against some
existing survivable virtual network embedding techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05300v1,cs.DC

for researchers to find themselves not studying a single network but needing to
analyze sets of networks. An important task when working with sets of networks

accomplish this task remains an open area of research. Here we introduce a new
measure to compare networks, the Network Portrait Divergence, that is
mathematically principled, incorporates the topological characteristics of
networks at all structural scales, and is general-purpose and applicable to all
types of networks. An important feature of our measure that enables many of its
useful properties is that it is based on a graph invariant, the network

emergent behavior. A particularly advantageous way to study these systems is
through the analysis of the networks that encode the interactions among the

systems. However, real systems are more often than not interconnected, with
many interdependencies that are not properly captured by single layer networks.
To account for this source of complexity, a more general framework, in which
different networks evolve or interact with each other, is needed. These are
known as multilayer networks. Here we provide an overview of the basic
methodology used to describe multilayer systems as well as of some

vertices, or of the vertices themselves, and the large amount of symmetry
present in real-world complex networks is inherited by such measures. This has
practical consequences which have not yet been explored in full generality, nor
systematically exploited by network practitioners. Here we study the effect of
network symmetry on arbitrary network measures, and show how this can be
exploited in practice in a number of ways, from redundancy compression, to
computational reduction. We also uncover the spectral signatures of symmetry
for an arbitrary network measure such as the graph Laplacian. Computing network
symmetries is very efficient in practice, and we test real-world examples up to
several million nodes. Since network models are ubiquitous in the Applied

measurement error and noise. At the same time, the data may be richer than
simple network measurements, incorporating multiple measurements, weights,
lengths or strengths of edges, node or edge labels, or annotations of various

stochastic block models for multilayer and temporal networks; one of them uses
nodes as its fundamental unit, whereas the other focuses on links. We also
develop scalable algorithms for inferring the parameters of these models.
Because our models describe all layers simultaneously, our approach takes full
advantage of the information contained in the whole network when making
predictions about any particular layer. We illustrate the potential of our
approach by analyzing two empirical datasets---a temporal network of email
communications, and a network of drug interactions for treating different
cancer types. We find that modeling all layers simultaneously does result, in
general, in more accurate link prediction. However, the most predictive model
depends on the dataset under consideration; whereas the node-based model is
more appropriate for predicting drug interactions, the link-based model is more
appropriate for predicting email communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01616v1,physics.soc-ph

Despite a large variety of non-equilibrium (growing) and equilibrium (static)
sparse complex network models that are widely used in network science, how to
reconcile sparseness (constant average degree) with the desired statistical
properties of projectivity and exchangeability is currently an outstanding
scientific problem. Here we propose a network process with hidden variables
which is projective and can generate sparse power-law networks. Despite the
model not being exchangeable, it can be closely related to exchangeable
uncorrelated networks as indicated by its information theory characterization

long chains to study deformation mechanism of crazing and associated void

constituting the polymer play a crucial role in crazing. Thus, we have
reconstructed two underlying weighted networks, namely, the Van der Waals
network and the Entanglement network from polymer configurations extracted from
the molecular dynamics simulation. Subsequently, we have performed
graph-theoretic analysis of the two reconstructed networks to reveal the role
played by them in crazing of polymers. Our analysis captured various stages of
crazing through specific trends in the network measures for Van der Waals

observe all relevant networks. We show that, unlike conventional omitted
variable bias, bias due to unobserved networks remains even when treatment
assignment is randomized and when unobserved networks and a network of interest

state network (ESN) has been applied to a wide range of fields, from robotics
to medicine, finance, and language processing. A key feature of the ESN
paradigm is its reservoir --- a directed and weighted network of neurons that
projects the input time series into a high dimensional space where linear
regression or classification can be applied. Despite extensive studies, the
impact of the reservoir network on the ESN performance remains unclear.
Combining tools from physics, dynamical systems and network science, we attempt
to open the black box of ESN and offer insights to understand the behavior of
general artificial neural networks. Through spectral analysis of the reservoir
network we reveal a key factor that largely determines the ESN memory capacity
and hence affects its performance. Moreover, we find that adding short loops to
the reservoir network can tailor ESN for specific tasks and optimize learning.
We validate our findings by applying ESN to forecast both synthetic and real
benchmark time series. Our results provide a new way to design task-specific
ESN. More importantly, it demonstrates the power of combining tools from
physics, dynamical systems and network science to offer new insights in
understanding the mechanisms of general artificial neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02469v4,cs.LG

(1) Orchestrating Network Formation: We consider the problem of orchestrating
formation of a social network having a certain given topology that may be
desirable for the intended usecases. Assuming the social network nodes to be
strategic in forming relationships, we derive conditions under which a given
topology can be uniquely obtained. We also study the efficiency and robustness
of the derived conditions. (2) Multi-phase Influence Maximization: We propose
that information diffusion be carried out in multiple phases rather than in a
single instalment. With the objective of achieving better diffusion, we
discover optimal ways of splitting the available budget among the phases,
determining the time delay between consecutive phases, and also finding the
individuals to be targeted for initiating the diffusion process. (3) Scalable
Preference Aggregation: It is extremely useful to determine a small number of
representatives of a social network such that the individual preferences of
these nodes, when aggregated, reflect the aggregate preference of the entire
network. Using real-world data collected from Facebook with human subjects, we
discover a model that faithfully captures the spread of preferences in a social
network. We hence propose fast and reliable ways of computing a truly
representative aggregate preference of the entire network. In particular, we
develop models and methods for solving the above problems, which primarily deal
with formation and analysis of social networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09310v1,cs.SI

the mechanism behind the emergence of new trends? By representing real-world
dynamic systems as complex networks, the emergence of new trends can be
symbolized by vertices that ""shine."" That is, at a specific time interval in a
network's life, certain vertices become increasingly connected to other
vertices. This process creates new high-degree vertices, i.e., network stars.
Thus, to study trends, we must look at how networks evolve over time and
determine how the stars behave. In our research, we constructed the largest
publicly available network evolution dataset to date, which contains 38,000
real-world networks and 2.5 million graphs. Then, we performed the first
precise wide-scale analysis of the evolution of networks with various scales.
Three primary observations resulted: (a) links are most prevalent among
vertices that join a network at a similar time; (b) the rate that new vertices
join a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; and (c) the
emergence of network stars (high-degree vertices) is correlated with
fast-growing networks. We applied our learnings to develop a flexible
network-generation model based on large-scale, real-world data. This model
gives a better understanding of how stars rise and fall within networks, and is
applicable to dynamic systems both in nature and society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06690v3,cs.SI

enhancing interwoven long loops. In particular, we consider the range-limited
approximation of linking by intermediations in a few hops, and show the strong
robustness in the growth without degrading efficiency of paths. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the tolerance of connectivity is reformable even from

networks such as twitter. Agents are nodes, connecting to another agent by
building a directed edge has a cost, and reaching other agents via short
directed paths has a benefit; in effect, an agent wants to reach others
quickly, but without the cost of directly connecting each and every one. Even
in its simplest form, edges in this framework are neither substitutes or
complements in general; hence, standard techniques are required to study the
model's properties and dynamics do not apply.
  We prove that an asynchronous edge dynamics always converge to a stable
network; in fact, for this convergence is fast for a range of parameters.
Moreover, the set of stable networks are nontrivial and can support the type of
network structures that have been observed to appear in social information
networks -- from community clusters to broadcast networks, depending on the
parameters many natural formations can emerge. We further study the static

some circles as information centrality. This is an important notion of
centrality for undirected networks, with many applications, e.g., for random
walks, electrical resistor networks, epidemic spreading, etc. In this paper, we
first reinterpret this measure in terms of modulus (energy) of families of
walks on the network. This modulus centrality measure coincides with the
effective conductance measure on simple undirected networks, and extends it to
much more general situations, e.g., directed networks as well. Secondly, we
study a variation of this modulus approach in the egocentric network paradigm.
Egonetworks are networks formed around a focal node (ego) with a specific order
of neighborhoods. We propose efficient analytical and approximate methods for

used to find hierarchical grouping of journals into blocks that show similar

citation network without the need to construct auxiliary networks based on
similarity of nodes. We fit the SBMs to the networks of journals we have
constructed from the data set of around 630 million citations and find a
variety of different types of blocks, such as clusters, bridges, sources, and
sinks. In addition we use a recent generalization of SBMs to determine how much
a manually curated classification of journals into subfields of science is
related to the block structure of the journal network and how this relationship
changes in time. The SBM method tries to find a network of blocks that is the

networks depicting functional relationships between brain areas, has opened new
insights into the function of the human brain. In this approach, the choice of
network nodes is of crucial importance. One option is to consider fMRI voxels
as nodes. This results in a large number of nodes, making network analysis and
interpretation of results challenging. A common alternative is to use
pre-defined clusters of anatomically close voxels, Regions of Interest (ROIs).
This approach assumes that voxels within ROIs are functionally similar. Because
these two approaches result in different network structures, it is crucial to
understand what happens to network connectivity when moving from the voxel
level to the ROI level. We show that the consistency of ROIs, defined as the
mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of their voxels,
varies widely in resting-state experimental data. Therefore the assumption of
similar voxel dynamics within each ROI does not generally hold. Further, the
time series of low-consistency ROIs may be highly correlated, resulting in
spurious links in ROI-level networks. Based on these results, we recommend that
averaging BOLD signals over anatomically defined ROIs should be carefully
considered.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.07635v1,q-bio.NC

underlying network which is obfuscated by measurement errors. It is well known
that such errors can have a severe impact on the reliability of network
metrics, especially on centrality measures: a more central node in the observed
network might be less central in the underlying network.
  We introduce a metric for the reliability of centrality measures -- called
sensitivity. Given two randomly chosen nodes, the sensitivity means the
probability that the more central node in the observed network is also more
central in the underlying network. The sensitivity concept relies on the
underlying network which is usually not accessible. Therefore, we propose two
methods to approximate the sensitivity. The iterative method, which simulates
possible underlying networks for the estimation and the imputation method,
which uses the sensitivity of the observed network for the estimation. Both
methods rely on the observed network and assumptions about the underlying type
of measurement error (e.g., the percentage of missing edges or nodes).
  Our experiments on real-world networks and random graphs show that the
iterative method performs well in many cases. In contrast, the imputation
method does not yield useful estimations for networks other than
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01045v2,cs.SI

propose a new nodal centrality measure for multiplex networks. Our measure,
called Opinion centrality, is based on a stochastic model representing opinion
propagation dynamics in such a network. We formulate an optimization problem
consisting in maximizing the opinion of the whole network when controlling an
external influence able to affect each node individually. We find a
mathematical closed form of this problem, and use its solution to derive our
centrality measure. According to the opinion centrality, the more a node is
worth investing external influence, and the more it is central. We perform an

which indeed brings a new and insightful language to model real systems of

science, is a decent proxy in investigating network loads and rankings.
However, the extremely high computational cost greatly prevents its applying on
large networks. Though several parallel algorithms have been presented to
reduce its calculation cost on unweighted networks, a fast solution for
weighted networks, which are in fact more ubiquitous than unweighted ones in

identify themselves with different usernames across social media sites. This
creates a great difficulty in detecting the community structure. In this paper,
we explore several approaches for community detection across online social
networks with limited knowledge of username alignment across the networks. We

for seed selection and its impact on networks with a different fraction of
overlapping vertices. The goal is to study the interplay between network

interest, they spontaneously form a feedback loop: virus propagation triggers
cascading failures of systems while cascading failures suppress virus
propagation. Especially, there exists crucial threshold of virus
transmissibility, above which the interdependent networks collapse completely.
In addition, the interdependent networks will be more vulnerable if the network
supporting virus propagation has denser connections; otherwise the
interdependent systems are robust against the change of connections in other
layer(s). This discovery differs from previous framework of cascading failure
in interdependent networks, where better robustness usually needs denser

Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we must ask: Are there
any advantages of the networks' temporality? Here we develop an analytical
framework to explore the control properties of temporal networks, arriving at
the counterintuitive conclusion that temporal networks, compared to their
static (i.e. aggregated) counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand
orders of magnitude less control energy, and the control trajectories, through
which the system reaches its final states, are significantly more compact than
those characterizing their static counterparts. The combination of analytical,

biological systems, researchers develop maps that reveal important patterns in
network flows. In practice, network flow models have implied memoryless
first-order Markov chains, but recently researchers have introduced
higher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step
pathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively
revealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov
chain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter
spaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore
make mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this
problem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on
network flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we
present a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in

curvature to the realm of undirected networks. Investigation of Forman
curvature in diverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that
this measure captures several aspects of the organization of complex undirected
networks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed
in nature, and the Forman curvature for undirected networks is unsuitable for
analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we here extend the Forman curvature
for undirected networks to the case of directed networks. The simple
mathematical formula for the Forman curvature in directed networks elegantly
incorporates node weights, edge weights and edge direction. By applying the
Forman curvature for directed networks to a variety of model and real-world
directed networks, we show that the measure can be used to characterize the
structure of complex directed networks. Furthermore, our results also hold in
real directed networks which are weighted or spatial in nature. These results
in combination with our previous results suggest that the Forman curvature can
be readily employed to study the organization of both directed and undirected

ad hoc networks, maximizing the network lifetime is the first concern in the
related designing and maintaining activities. We study the network lifetime
from the perspective of network science. In our dynamic network, nodes are
assigned a fixed amount of energy initially and consume the energy in the
delivery of packets. We divided the network traffic flow into four states: no,
slow, fast, and absolute congestion states. We derive the network lifetime by
considering the state of the traffic flow. We find that the network lifetime is
generally opposite to traffic congestion in that the more congested traffic,
the less network lifetime. We also find the impacts of factors such as packet
generation rate, communication radius, node moving speed, etc., on network
lifetime and traffic congestion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07099v1,cs.NI

The existence of negative links determines that properties and principles of
signed networks are substantially distinct from those of unsigned networks,

understanding the underlying structure of various real-world networks and to
answer non-trivial questions regarding them. In this study, we rigourously
analyze the statistical properties of the bus networks of six major Indian
cities as graphs in L- and P-space, using tools from network science. Although
public transport networks, such as airline and railway networks have been
extensively studied, a comprehensive study on the structure and growth of bus
networks is lacking. In India, where bus networks play an important role in
day-to-day commutation, it is of significant interest to analyze their
topological structure, and answer some of the basic questions on their
evolution, growth, robustness and resiliency. We start from an empirical
analysis of these networks, and determine their principle characteristics in
terms of the complex network theory. The common features of small-world
property and heavy tails in degree-distribution plots are observed in all the
networks studied. Our analysis further reveals a wide spectrum of network
topologies arising due to an interplay between preferential and random
attachment of nodes. Unlike real-world networks, like the Internet, WWW and
airline, which are virtual, bus networks are physically constrained in
two-dimensional space by the underlying road networks. In order to understand
the role of constraints in the evolution of these networks, we calculate their
fractal dimensions that reveal a three-dimensional space-like evolution in a

maliciously) used to compel a computing device or a network of computing
devices to perform actions desired by the perpetrator of malicious software

observed, which lead to incomplete networks. Analysis of such incomplete
networks can lead to skewed results. We examine the following problem: given an
incomplete network, which $b$ nodes should be probed to bring the largest
number of new nodes into the observed network? Many graph-mining tasks require
having observed a considerable amount of the network. Examples include
community discovery, belief propagation, influence maximization, etc. For
instance, consider someone who has observed a portion (say 1%) of the Twitter
retweet network via random tweet sampling. She wants to estimate the size of
the largest connected component of the fully observed retweet network. To
improve her estimate, how should she use her limited budget to reduce the
incompleteness of the network? In this work, we propose a novel algorithm,

introduce a network dissection process to fully unveil the origin of the role
of individual nodes and links in control, giving rise to a criterion for the
much needed strong structural controllability. We theoretically uncover various
phase-transition phenomena associated with the role of nodes and links and
strong structural controllability. Applying our theory to a large number of

controlled, but we also want to establish whether the control can be performed
using a limited amount of energy. We restrict our study to irreducible and
(marginally) stable networks and we find that the leading right and left
eigenvectors of the network matrix play a crucial role in this analysis.
Interestingly, our results suggest the existence of a connection between
controllability and network centrality, a well-known concept in network
science. In case the network is reversible, the latter connection involves the
PageRank, an extensively studied type of centrality measure. Finally, the

networks be efficient? A substantial theoretical literature predicts that the
only networks that can form and persist must have very special shapes and that
such networks cannot be efficient, but these predictions are in stark contrast

formation. In contrast to the existing literature, our model is dynamic (rather
than static), we model agents as foresighted (rather than myopic) and we allow
for the possibility that agents are heterogeneous (rather than homogeneous). We
show that a very wide variety of networks can form and persist; in particular,
efficient networks can form and persist if they provide every agent a strictly
positive payoff. For the widely-studied connections model, we provide a full

the response to perturbations has been quantified, recovery strategies for
perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through
anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science-based quantitative
methods framework for measuring, comparing and interpreting hazard responses
and as well as recovery strategies. The framework, motivated by the recently
proposed temporal resilience paradigm, is demonstrated with the Indian Railways
Network. The methods are demonstrated through the resilience of the network to
natural or human-induced hazards and electric grid failure. Simulations
inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as
well as a cyber-physical attack scenario. Multiple metrics are used to generate
various recovery strategies, which are simply sequences in which system
components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of
recovery strategies suggests that faster and more resource-effective recovery
is possible through network centrality measures. Case studies based on two
historical events, specifically the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2012

availability of data, over the last two decades, the field of network science
has established itself as an own area of research. With quantitative scientists
from computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from
biology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network
science serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major
goals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological
graph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from
the same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure.
However, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically
implies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this
gap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a
general introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work
devoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major
challenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node
subgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may
participate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle,
a novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic
building blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs -
subgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at
random - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs.
Finally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical
processes acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs
impose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a
larger network structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03989v1,cs.SI

this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for this problem that makes use of
sampling in order to handle large datasets. Our algorithm can handle time

fascinating and counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes that emerge due to
different types of interdependencies between otherwise independent populations.

network deduced from a large-scale co-authorship network. The nodes of the
overlapping community network represent the functional communities of the
co-authorship network, and the links account for the fact that communities
share some nodes in the co-authorship network. The comparative evaluation of
the topological properties of these two networks shows that they share similar
topological properties. These results are very interesting. Indeed, the network

This implies that the vertices are measurable by a metric and there exists a
linear structure in the system. The generalization is an embedding of a graph
onto a multi-dimensional Euclidean space and it was used by scientists to study
the multi-relational complexity of ecology. However the research went out of

its evaluation. While their content and structure differ substantially, there
exist only informal notions on their reliability. Here we compare the
topological consistency of citation networks extracted from six popular
bibliographic databases including Web of Science, CiteSeer and arXiv.org. The
networks are assessed through a rich set of local and global graph statistics.
We first reveal statistically significant inconsistencies between some of the
databases with respect to individual statistics. For example, the introduced
field bow-tie decomposition of DBLP Computer Science Bibliography substantially
differs from the rest due to the coverage of the database, while the citation
information within arXiv.org is the most exhaustive. Finally, we compare the
databases over multiple graph statistics using the critical difference diagram.
The citation topology of DBLP Computer Science Bibliography is the least
consistent with the rest, while, not surprisingly, Web of Science is
significantly more reliable from the perspective of consistency. This work can
serve either as a reference for scholars in bibliometrics and scientometrics or
a scientific evaluation guideline for governments and research agencies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05061v1,cs.DL

revenue of their cloud datacenters by accommodating virtual network requests as
many as possible. However, arrival and departure of virtual network requests
fragment physical network's resources and reduce the possibility of accepting

in network science as it is closely associated with the reliability and
functionality of various networking paradigms. However, despite the study on
intrinsic topological vulnerabilities to node removals, little is known on the
network robustness when network defense mechanisms are implemented, especially
for networked engineering systems equipped with detection capabilities. In this
paper, a sequential defense mechanism is firstly proposed in complex networks
for attack inference and vulnerability assessment, where the data fusion center
sequentially infers the presence of an attack based on the binary attack status
reported from the nodes in the network. The network robustness is evaluated in
terms of the ability to identify the attack prior to network disruption under
two major attack schemes, i.e., random and intentional attacks. We provide a
parametric plug-in model for performance evaluation on the proposed mechanism
and validate its effectiveness and reliability via canonical complex network
models and real-world large-scale network topology. The results show that the
sequential defense mechanism greatly improves the network robustness and
mitigates the possibility of network disruption by acquiring limited attack
status information from a small subset of nodes in the network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00065v1,cs.SI

represents a different type of relationship between the nodes in the network
and is designed to maximize some utility that depends on the topology of that
layer and those of the other layers. We start by generalizing distance-based
network formation to the two-layer setting, where edges are constructed in one
layer (with fixed cost per edge) to minimize distances between nodes that are
neighbors in another layer. We show that designing an optimal network in this
setting is NP-hard. Despite the underlying complexity of the problem, we
characterize certain properties of the optimal networks. We then formulate a
multi-layer network formation game where each layer corresponds to a player
that is optimally choosing its edge set in response to the edge sets of the
other players. We consider utility functions that view the different layers as
strategic substitutes. By applying our results about optimal networks, we show
that players with low edge costs drive players with high edge costs out of the
game, and that hub-and-spoke networks that are commonly observed in
transportation systems arise as Nash equilibria in this game.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02866v2,cs.GT

Nash equilibria of a network construction game whose purpose is to find an

bipartite networks. In various areas of science, engineering and commerce, many
types of information can be represented as networks, and thus the discipline of
network analysis plays an important role in these domains. A powerful and
widespread class of network analysis methods is based on algebraic graph
theory, i.e., representing graphs as square adjacency matrices. However, many
networks are of a very specific form that clashes with that representation:
They are bipartite. That is, they consist of two node types, with each edge
connecting a node of one type with a node of the other type. Examples of
bipartite networks (also called \emph{two-mode networks}) are persons and the
social groups they belong to, musical artists and the musical genres they play,
and text documents and the words they contain. In fact, any type of feature
that can be represented by a categorical variable can be interpreted as a
bipartite network. Although bipartite networks are widespread, most literature
in the area of network analysis focuses on unipartite networks, i.e., those
networks with only a single type of node. The purpose of this article is to
extend a selection of important algebraic network analysis methods to bipartite
networks, showing that many methods from algebraic graph theory can be applied
to bipartite networks with only minor modifications. We show methods for
clustering, visualization and link prediction. Additionally, we introduce new
algebraic methods for measuring the bipartivity in near-bipartite graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6073v2,cs.DM

coming to prominence within the last decade. Network science approaches have
facilitated these analyses and allowed examining the brain as an integrated

network science presents the best path to develop these methods. Toward this
end, we propose a two-part mixed-effects modeling framework that allows
modeling both the probability of a connection (presence/absence of an edge) and
the strength of a connection if it exists. Models within this framework enable
quantifying the relationship between an outcome (e.g., disease status) and
connectivity patterns in the brain while reducing spurious correlations through
inclusion of confounding covariates. They also enable prediction about an
outcome based on connectivity structure and vice versa, simulating networks to
gain a better understanding of normal ranges of topological variability, and
thresholding networks leveraging group information. Thus, they provide a
comprehensive approach to studying system level brain properties to further our
understanding of normal and abnormal brain function.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7086v1,stat.AP

attention in the domain of sociology and behavioral sciences. Social networks
also exhibit dynamic nature as these networks change continuously with the
passage of time. Social networks might also present a hierarchical structure
led by individuals that play important roles in a society such as Managers and
Decision Makers. Detection and Visualization of these networks changing over

  In this paper we address these issues by presenting a system to analyze
dynamic social networks. The proposed system is based on dynamic graph
discretization and graph clustering. The system allows detection of major
structural changes taking place in social communities over time and reveals
hierarchies by identifying influential people in a social networks. We use two

comprehend interconnected systems across the social and natural sciences. To
identify different types of functional modules in interaction data aggregated
in a single network layer, researchers have developed many powerful methods.
For example, flow-based methods have proven useful for identifying modular
dynamics in weighted and directed networks that capture constraints on flow in
the systems they represent. However, many networked systems consist of agents
or components that exhibit multiple layers of interactions. Inevitably,
representing this intricate network of networks as a single aggregated network
leads to information loss and may obscure the actual organization. Here we
propose a method based on compression of network flows that can identify
modular flows in non-aggregated multilayer networks. Our numerical experiments
on synthetic networks show that the method can accurately identify modules that
cannot be identified in aggregated networks or by analyzing the layers
separately. We capitalize on our findings and reveal the community structure of
two multilayer collaboration networks: scientists affiliated to the Pierre
Auger Observatory and scientists publishing works on networks on the arXiv.
Compared to conventional aggregated methods, the multilayer method reveals
smaller modules with more overlap that better capture the actual organization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2925v1,physics.soc-ph

flip from one state to another is among the remaining challenges in network
science. However, due to the stochastic nature of critical transitions it is
widely believed that critical points are difficult to estimate, and it is even
more difficult, if not impossible, to predict the time such transitions occur
[1-4]. We analyze a class of decaying dynamical networks experiencing
persistent attacks in which the magnitude of the attack is quantified by the
probability of an internal failure, and there is some chance that an internal
failure will be permanent. When the fraction of active neighbors declines to a
critical threshold, cascading failures trigger a network breakdown. For this
class of network we find both numerically and analytically that the time to the
network breakdown, equivalent to the network lifetime, is inversely dependent
upon the magnitude of the attack and logarithmically dependent on the
threshold. We analyze how permanent attacks affect dynamical network robustness

physical, and virtual systems. A profound complication for the science of
complex networks is that in most cases, observing all nodes and all network
interactions is impossible. Previous work addressing the impacts of partial
network data is surprisingly limited, focuses primarily on missing nodes, and
suggests that network statistics derived from subsampled data are not suitable
estimators for the same network statistics describing the overall network
topology. We generate scaling methods to predict true network statistics,
including the degree distribution, from only partial knowledge of nodes, links,
or weights. Our methods are transparent and do not assume a known generating
process for the network, thus enabling prediction of network statistics for a
wide variety of applications. We validate analytical results on four simulated
network classes and empirical data sets of various sizes. We perform
subsampling experiments by varying proportions of sampled data and demonstrate
that our scaling methods can provide very good estimates of true network
statistics while acknowledging limits. Lastly, we apply our techniques to a set

updating rule. However, a recent empirical result shows the heterogeneous
networks do not promote cooperation when humans play a Prisoner's Dilemma. In
this paper, we propose a strategy updating rule with payoff memory. We observe
that the random graphs and small-world networks can provide even better
frameworks for cooperation than the scale-free networks in this scenario. Our
observations suggest that the degree heterogeneity may be neither a sufficient

link the mesoscopic network dynamics (represented by sampled functional
networks) and the microscopic network structure (represented by an
integrate-and-fire neural network located in a 3D space -- hence the term

correlations between time-series of mesoscopic electric potential dynamics,
which allows the construction of a graph where each node represents one
time-series. The spatial neural network model is central in this study in the
sense that it allowed us to characterize sampled functional networks in terms
of what features they are able to reproduce from the underlying spatial

cases, they require to be modeled by interconnected multilayer networks,
characterizing interactions on several levels simultaneously. It is of crucial
importance in many fields, from economics to biology, from urban planning to
social sciences, to identify the most (or the less) influent nodes in a
network. However, defining the centrality of actors in an interconnected
structure is not trivial.
  In this paper, we capitalize on the tensorial formalism, recently proposed to
characterize and investigate this kind of complex topologies, to show how
several centrality measures -- well-known in the case of standard (""monoplex"")
networks -- can be extended naturally to the realm of interconnected
multiplexes. We consider diagnostics widely used in different fields, e.g.,
computer science, biology, communication and social sciences, to cite only some
of them. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that using the weighted
monoplex obtained by aggregating the multilayer network leads, in general, to
relevant differences in ranking the nodes by their importance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2906v1,physics.soc-ph

deletion of links among a set of actors (e.g. individuals or organizations).
Longitudinal social networks are studied by network science and social science
researchers to understand networke volution, trend propagation, friendship and

more. In the current literature, there are different approaches and methods
(e.g. Sampsons approach and the markov model) to study the dynamics of
longitudinal social networks. These approaches and methods have mainly been
utilised to explore evolutionary changes of longitudinal social networks from
one state to another and to explain the underlying reasons for these changes.
However, they cannot quantify the level of dynamicity of the over time network
changes and the contribution of individual network members (i.e. actors) to
these changes. In this study, we first develop a set of measures to quantify
different aspects of the dynamicity of a longitudinal social network. We then
apply these measures, in order to conduct empirical investigations, to two

the application of these measures and possible future research directions of

neither randomness nor preferential attachment is a mechanism of community
structures of network \footnote{A. Li, J. Li, and Y. Pan, Community structures
are definable in networks, and universal in the real world, To appear.}. This
poses a fundamental question: What are the mechanisms of community structures
of real networks? Here we found that homophyly is the mechanism of community
structures and a structural theory of networks. We proposed a homophyly model.
It was shown that networks of our model satisfy a series of new topological,
probabilistic and combinatorial principles, including a fundamental principle,
a community structure principle, a degree priority principle, a widths
principle, an inclusion and infection principle, a king node principle, and a
predicting principle etc, leading to a structural theory of networks. Our model
demonstrates that homophyly is the underlying mechanism of community structures

structural controllability of directed networks characterized by structural
matrices. We explore the controllability of a large number of real and model

attracted great research interests recently. A key challenge is that it is of
extremely large-scale with tremendous information flow, creating the phenomenon
of ""Big Data"". Under such a circumstance, understanding information diffusion
over social networks has become an important research issue. Most of the
existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on either network
structure modeling or empirical approach with dataset mining. However, the
information diffusion is also heavily influenced by network users' decisions,
actions and their socio-economic connections, which is generally ignored in
existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic
framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social
networks. Specifically, we analyze the framework in uniform degree and
non-uniform degree networks and derive the closed-form expressions of the
evolutionary stable network states. Moreover, the information diffusion over
two special networks, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network and the
Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free network, are also highlighted. To verify our
theoretical analysis, we conduct experiments by using both synthetic networks

theoretic framework is effective and practical in modeling the social network

study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge flow
network in that a node represents a Journal Citation Report subject category

the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed
and applied to a knowledge flow network. Based on an examination of subject
categories in Journal Citation Report, this paper finds that social science
domains tend to be more self-contained and thus it is more difficult for
knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge
from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related
domains can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This paper
also finds that social science domains are more disunified than science
domains, as three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain
to another need at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This

identifying complex network structures using a mixture of node and link
communities, called hybrid node-link communities. A central piece of our
approach is a probabilistic model that accommodates node, link and hybrid
node-link communities. Our extensive experiments on various real-world

between networks are of the outmost importance. We therefore study the outcome
of the public goods game on two interdependent networks that are connected by
means of a utility function, which determines how payoffs on both networks
jointly influence the success of players in each individual network. We show
that an unbiased coupling allows the spontaneous emergence of interdependent
network reciprocity, which is capable to maintain healthy levels of public
cooperation even in extremely adverse conditions. The mechanism, however,
requires simultaneous formation of correlated cooperator clusters on both
networks. If this does not emerge or if the coordination process is disturbed,
network reciprocity fails, resulting in the total collapse of cooperation.
Network interdependence can thus be exploited effectively to promote
cooperation past the limits imposed by isolated networks, but only if the

technology, and applications. To date, most algorithms that aim to find
community structures only focus either on unipartite or bipartite networks. A
unipartite network consists of one set of nodes and a bipartite network
consists of two nonoverlapping sets of nodes with only links joining the nodes
in different sets. However, a third type of network exists, defined here as the
mixture network. Just like a bipartite network, a mixture network also consists
of two sets of nodes, but some nodes may simultaneously belong to two sets,
which breaks the nonoverlapping restriction of a bipartite network. The mixture
network can be considered as a general case, with unipartite and bipartite
networks viewed as its limiting cases. A mixture network can represent not only
all the unipartite and bipartite networks, but also a wide range of real-world
networks that cannot be properly represented as either unipartite or bipartite
networks in fields such as biology and social science. Based on this
observation, we first propose a probabilistic model that can find modules in
unipartite, bipartite, and mixture networks in a unified framework based on the
link community model for a unipartite undirected network [B Ball et al (2011
Phys. Rev. E 84 036103)]. We test our algorithm on synthetic networks (both
overlapping and nonoverlapping communities) and apply it to two real-world

regulatory mixture network. The results suggest that our model performs well

unipartite or bipartite networks, and is applicable to real-world networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.7569v4,physics.soc-ph

topology of the network can be changed by the nodes in the network. For
example, peer-to-peer, wireless and ad-hoc networks are reconfigurable. More
generally, many social networks, such as a company's organizational chart;
infrastructure networks, such as an airline's transportation network; and
biological networks, such as the human brain, are also reconfigurable. Modern
reconfigurable networks have a complexity unprecedented in the history of
engineering, resembling more a dynamic and evolving living animal rather than a
structure of steel designed from a blueprint. Unfortunately, our mathematical
and algorithmic tools have not yet developed enough to handle this complexity
and fully exploit the flexibility of these networks.
  We believe that it is no longer possible to build networks that are scalable
and never have node failures. Instead, these networks should be able to admit
small, and maybe, periodic failures and still recover like skin heals from a
cut. This process, where the network can recover itself by maintaining key
invariants in response to attack by a powerful adversary is what we call
\emph{self-healing}.
  Here, we present several fast and provably good distributed algorithms for
self-healing in reconfigurable dynamic networks. Each of these algorithms have
different properties, a different set of gaurantees and limitations. We also

temporal networks and show that on the Web, networks follow a nonlinear
preferential attachment model in which the exponent depends on the type of
network considered. The classical preferential attachment model for networks by
Barab\'asi and Albert (1999) assumes a linear relationship between the number
of neighbors of a node in a network and the probability of attachment. Although
this assumption is widely made in Web Science and related fields, the
underlying linearity is rarely measured. To fill this gap, this paper performs
an empirical longitudinal (time-based) study on forty-seven diverse Web network
datasets from seven network categories and including directed, undirected and
bipartite networks. We show that contrary to the usual assumption, preferential
attachment is nonlinear in the networks under consideration. Furthermore, we
observe that the deviation from linearity is dependent on the type of network,
giving sublinear attachment in certain types of networks, and superlinear
attachment in others. Thus, we introduce the preferential attachment exponent
$\beta$ as a novel numerical network measure that can be used to discriminate

by the fact that, similar to existing EGT studies, node behavior in dynamic
wireless networks is characterized by decision making that only depends on the
immediate neighborhood. We adapt our model to study cooperation behavior in the

problem in network science. The traditional and well-known assortativity
coefficient is calculated on a per-network basis, which is of little use to
partial connection tendency of a network. This paper proposes a universal
assortativity coefficient(UAC), which is based on the unambiguous definition of
each individual edge's contribution to the global assortativity coefficient
(GAC). It is able to reveal the connection tendency of microscopic, mesoscopic,
macroscopic structures and any given part of a network. Applying UAC to real
world networks, we find that, contrary to the popular expectation, most
networks (notably the AS-level Internet topology) have markedly more
assortative edges/nodes than dissortaive ones despite their global
dissortativity. Consequently, networks can be categorized along two
dimensions--single global assortativity and local assortativity statistics.

Traditionally multicasting has been implemented over a specialized network

requiring the deployment of special routers that are more expensive than
ordinary routers. Recently there is new interest in delivering multicast
traffic over application layer overlay networks. Application layer overlay
networks though built on top of the physical network, behave like an
independent virtual network made up of only logical links between the nodes.

mechanism underlying metabolic network modularity is of great interest not only
to researchers of basic science but also to those in fields of engineering.
Previous studies have suggested a theoretical model, which proposes that a
change in the evolutionary goal (system-specific purpose) increases network
modularity, and this hypothesis was supported by statistical data analysis.
Nevertheless, further investigation has uncovered additional possibilities that
might explain the origin of network modularity. In this work, we propose an
evolving network model without tuning parameters to describe metabolic
networks. We demonstrate, quantitatively, that metabolic network modularity can
arise from simple growth processes, independent of the change in the
evolutionary goal. Our model is applicable to a wide range of organisms, and
appears to suggest that metabolic network modularity can be more simply
determined than previously thought. Nonetheless, our proposition does not serve

role in a variety of knowledge management and information diffusion tasks. The
nodes in these networks correspond to individuals who are self-interested. The
topology of these networks often plays a crucial role in deciding the ease and
speed with which certain tasks can be accomplished using these networks.
Consequently, growing a stable network having a certain topology is of
interest. Motivated by this, we study the following important problem: given a
certain desired network topology, under what conditions would best response
(link addition/deletion) strategies played by self-interested agents lead to
formation of a pairwise stable network with only that topology. We study this
interesting reverse engineering problem by proposing a natural model of
recursive network formation. In this model, nodes enter the network
sequentially and the utility of a node captures principal determinants of
network formation, namely (1) benefits from immediate neighbors, (2) costs of
maintaining links with immediate neighbors, (3) benefits from indirect
neighbors, (4) bridging benefits, and (5) network entry fee. Based on this
model, we analyze relevant network topologies such as star graph, complete
graph, bipartite Turan graph, and multiple stars with interconnected centers,

heterogeneous structure of collaborative communities. However, we still have
limited theoretical understanding of how individual heterogeneity relates to
network heterogeneity. The model presented here provides a framework linking an
individual's skill set to her position in the collaboration network, and the
distribution of skills in the population to the structure of the collaboration
network as a whole. This model suggests that there is a non-trivial
relationship between skills and network position: individuals with a useful
combination of skills will have a disproportionate number of links in the
network. Indeed, in some cases, an individual's degree is non-monotonic in the
number of skills she has--an individual with very few skills may outperform an
individual with many. Special cases of the model suggest that the degree
distribution of the network will be skewed, even when the distribution of
skills is uniform in the population. The degree distribution becomes more
skewed as problems become more difficult, leading to a community dominated by a
few high-degree superstars. This has striking implications for labor market

highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path
lengths, like random graphs. These characteristics result in networks with
unique properties of regional specialization with efficient information
transfer. Social networks are intuitive examples of this organization with
cliques or clusters of friends being interconnected, but each person is really
only 5-6 people away from anyone else. While this qualitative definition has
prevailed in network science theory, in application, the standard quantitative
application is to compare path length (a surrogate measure of distributed
processing) and clustering (a surrogate measure of regional specialization) to
an equivalent random network. It is demonstrated here that comparing network
clustering to that of a random network can result in aberrant findings and
networks once thought to exhibit small-world properties may not. We propose a
new small-world metric, {\omega} (omega), which compares network clustering to
an equivalent lattice network and path length to a random network, as Watts and
Strogatz originally described. Example networks are presented that would be
interpreted as small-world when clustering is compared to a random network but
are not small-world according to {\omega}. These findings have significant

science and technology. Many networks such as the WWW and biological networks
are known to display spatial heterogeneity which can be characterized by their
fractal dimensions. Multifractal analysis is a useful way to systematically
describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal
patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new box covering algorithm for
multifractal analysis of complex networks. This algorithm is used to calculate
the generalized fractal dimensions $D_{q}$ of some theoretical networks, namely
scale-free networks, small world networks and random networks, and one kind of
real networks, namely protein-protein interaction networks of different
species. Our numerical results indicate the existence of multifractality in
scale-free networks and protein-protein interaction networks, while the
multifractal behavior is not clear-cut for small world networks and random
networks. The possible variation of $D_{q}$ due to changes in the parameters of
the theoretical network models is also discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5014v2,physics.bio-ph

demonstrate, using time series analysis of communication in three online

standard and novel network metrics to characterize how unexpected a network
configuration is, and to capture a network's ability to conduct information. We
find that networks with a higher conductance in link structure exhibit higher
information entropy, while unexpected network configurations can be tied to
information novelty. We use a simulation model to explain the observed

are studied. To analysis the fluid flow complexity in fracture networks with
respect to the variation of connectivity patterns, two different approaches are
employed, namely, the Lattice Boltzmann method and graph theory. The Lattice
Boltzmann method is used to show the sensitivity of the permeability and fluid
velocity distribution to synthetic fracture networks' connectivity patterns.
Furthermore, the fracture networks are mapped into the graphs, and the
characteristics of these graphs are compared to the main spatial fracture
networks. Among different characteristics of networks, we distinguish the
modularity of networks and sub-graphs distributions. We map the flow regimes
into the proper regions of the network's modularity space. Also, for each type
of fluid regime, corresponding motifs shapes are scaled. Implemented power law
distributions of fracture length in spatial fracture networks yielded the same
node's degree distribution in transformed networks. Two general spatial
networks are considered: random networks and networks with ""hubness"" properties
mimicking a spatial damage zone (both with power law distribution of fracture
length). In the first case, the fractures are embedded in uniformly distributed
fracture sets; the second case covers spatial fracture zones. We prove
numerically that the abnormal change (transition) in permeability is controlled
by the hub growth rate. Also, comparing LBM results with the characteristic
mean length of transformed networks' links shows a reverse relationship between
the aforementioned parameters. In addition, the abnormalities in advection
through nodes are presented.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4918v2,cs.CE

complex network analysis. As more data has been collected, researchers have
begun investigating changing community structure across multiple networks.
Several methods exist to analyze changing communities, but most of these are
limited to evolution of a single network over time. In addition, most of the
existing methods are more concerned with change at the community level than at
the level of the individual node. In this paper, we introduce scaled
inclusivity, which is a method to quantify the change in community structure
across networks. Scaled inclusivity evaluates the consistency of the
classiffication of every node in a network independently. In addition, the
method can be applied cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. In this
paper, we calculate the scaled inclusivity for a set of simulated networks of
United States cities and a set of real networks consisting of teams that play
in the top division of American college football. We found that scaled
inclusivity yields reasonable results for the consistency of individual nodes

node-degree distributions are restricted to only sparsely connected networks.
More densely connected networks, by contrast, show an increasing divergence
from power-law. This work shows that this observation is consistent with the
classic idea from social sciences that similarity is the driving factor behind
communication in social networks. The strong relation between communication
strength and node similarity could be confirmed by analyzing the Flickr

clustering of the network, the optimal number of levels and modular partition
at each level, with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search

discussion in everyday life. Formal statistical models for the analysis of
network data have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas of
study, and most of these involve a form of graphical representation.
Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with empirical studies in
social psychology and sociology from the 1960s, these early works generated an
active network community and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This effort
moved into the statistical literature in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the past
decade has seen a burgeoning network literature in statistical physics and
computer science. The growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence of online
networking communities such as Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, and a host of
more specialized professional network communities has intensified interest in
the study of networks and network data. Our goal in this review is to provide
the reader with an entry point to this burgeoning literature. We begin with an
overview of the historical development of statistical network modeling and then
we introduce a number of examples that have been studied in the network
literature. Our subsequent discussion focuses on a number of prominent static
and dynamic network models and their interconnections. We emphasize formal
model descriptions, and pay special attention to the interpretation of
parameters and their estimation. We end with a description of some open
problems and challenges for machine learning and statistics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.5410v1,stat.ME

publications has grown rapidly since 1965. However, the TH indicator shows that
the network dynamics have varied considerably according to the research
policies of the national government. The collaboration patterns, as measured by
co-authorship relations in the SCI noticeably increased, with some variation,
from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. However, inter-institutional collaboration
in the first decade of the 21st century was negatively influenced by the new
national science and technology (S&T) research policies that evaluated domestic
scientists and research groups based on their international publication numbers

has been separately investigated in last few years. Using trust has shown to be
one of the best ways of solving these problems. But using this approach to
simultaneously deal with both problems makes it impossible for newcomers to
join the network and the expansion of network is prevented. In this paper we
used the game theory to model the behavior of peers and developed a mechanism
in which free riding and providing bad service are dominated strategies for
peers. At the same time newcomers can participate and are encouraged to be
active in the network. The proposed model has been simulated and the results
showed that the trust value of free riders and bad service providers converge
to a finite value and trust of peers who provide good service is monotonically
increased despite the time they join the network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.0985v1,cs.NI

science in 1990 and 2000, and within six case studies at the sub-field level in

within the literature can be supported by a detailed review of the data. To
enable further exploration of the role of recognition and rewards as ordering
mechanisms within the system, we apply new tools emerging from network science.
These enquiries shows that the growth of international co-authorships can be
attributed to self-organizing phenomenon based on preferential attachment
(searching for recognition and reward) within networks of co-authors. The
co-authorship links can be considered as a complex network with sub-dynamics
involving features of both competition and cooperation. The analysis suggests
that the growth of international collaboration is more likely to emerge from

known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in
biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, or
genetic regulatory networks), or communities in social networks. Here we
present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network
data and demonstrate that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain
and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of
networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering
coefficients, and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of

distribution within each resistor of a large network. At the percolation
threshold, this distribution is multifractal in that all moments of this
distribution have independent scaling properties. We will discuss the meaning
of multifractal scaling and its implications for current flows in networks,

social systems, we introduce a new information theoretic approach that reveals
community structure in weighted and directed networks. The method decomposes a
network into modules by optimally compressing a description of information
flows on the network. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights
the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the
method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation
patterns of more than 6000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization
with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the
network of science. Along the backbone of the network -- including physics,
chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine -- information flows
bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the
applied fields to the basic sciences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.0609v3,physics.soc-ph

which has arisen recently on the interface of physics, biology, social and
computer sciences, and others. Its main goal is to discover general laws
governing the creation and growth as well as processes taking place on
networks, like e.g. the Internet, transportation or neural networks. It turned
out that most real-world networks cannot be simply reduced to a compound of
some individual components. Fortunately, the statistical mechanics, being one
of pillars of modern physics, provides us with a very powerful set of tools and
methods for describing and understanding these systems. In this thesis, we
would like to present a consistent approach to complex networks based on
statistical mechanics, with the central role played by the concept of
statistical ensemble of networks. We show how to construct such a theory and
present some practical problems where it can be applied. Among them, we pay
attention to the problem of finite-size corrections and the dynamics of a
simple model of mass transport on networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.3702v1,cond-mat.stat-mech

management system heavily inspired by social networks. Social networks have
been deeply studied in the last two decades in order to understand how
communities of people arise and grow. It is a widely known result that networks
of social relationships usually evolves to small-worlds, i.e. networks where
nodes are strongly connected to neighbours and separated from all other nodes
by a small amount of hops. This work shows that algorithms implemented into
PROSA allow to obtain an efficient small-world P2P network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0702127v1,cs.DC

functions should be described as unreduced many-body interaction process. The
latter gives rise to complex-dynamic behaviour including fractally structured
hierarchy of chaotically changing realisations. We recall the main results of
the universal science of complexity (physics/9806002) based on the unreduced
interaction problem solution and its application to various real systems, from
nanobiosystems (physics/0412097, physics/0502133) and quantum devices

consciousness (physics/0409140). We concentrate then on applications to
autonomic communication leading to fundamentally substantiated, exact science
of intelligent communication and software. It aims at unification of the whole
diversity of complex information system behaviour, similar to the conventional,

complex networks as well as its interplay with network topology. Building from
a recent work by Barahona and Pecora [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 054101 (2002)], we
use a simulated annealing algorithm to construct optimally-synchronizable
networks. The resulting structures, known as entangled networks, are
characterized by an extremely homogeneous and interwoven topology: degree,
distance, and betweenness distributions are all very narrow, with short average
distances, large loops, and small modularity. Entangled networks exhibit an
excellent (almost optimal) performance with respect to other flow or
connectivity properties such as robustness, random walk minimal first-passage
times, and good searchability. All this converts entangled networks in a
powerful concept with optimal properties in many respects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0602351v1,cond-mat.dis-nn

sciences, social sciences, and so on. In many cases, solving these problems
corresponds to minimizing the Bethe free energy. To minimize the Bethe free
energy, a statistical-mechanical iterative algorithm is often used. We study
the statistical-mechanical iterative algorithm on complex networks. To
investigate effects of heterogeneous structures on the iterative algorithm, we
introduce an iterative algorithm based on information of heterogeneity of
complex networks, in which higher-degree nodes are likely to be updated more
frequently than lower-degree ones. Numerical experiments clarified that the
usage of the information of heterogeneity affects the algorithm in BA networks,
but does not influence that in ER networks. It is revealed that information of
the whole system propagates rapidly through such high-degree nodes in the case
of Barab{\'a}si-Albert's scale-free networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0507322v2,cond-mat.dis-nn

contacts between computers, with different types of networks being exploited by
different types of infections. Here we analyze the structures of several of

control of infection. We argue that vaccination strategies that focus on a
limited number of network nodes, whether targeted or randomly chosen, are in
many cases unlikely to be effective. An alternative dynamic mechanism for the

effective under a range of conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0407048v1,cs.NI

evolution of complex networks is the hypothesis that highly connected nodes
increase their connectivity faster than their less connected peers, a
phenomenon called preferential attachment. Measurements on four networks,
namely the science citation network, Internet, actor collaboration and science
coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links
depends on the node's degree, offering direct quantitative support for the
presence of preferential attachment. We find that for the first two systems the
