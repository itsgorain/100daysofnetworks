Sana', 'F. Tramper', 'J. S. Vink', 'D. Pauli', 'J. Th. van Loon', 'F. Najarro', 'R. Kuiper', 'A. A. C. Sander', 'M. Bernini-Peron', 'The XShootU collaboration.']","We aim to investigate the theoretical bi-stability jump, which predicts an
increase in mass-loss rates below 21 kK. We further aim to constrain the
photospheric and wind parameters of a sample of 16 LMC late-O and B
supergiants. We utilise the 1D, non-LTE radiative transfer model CMFGEN in a
grid-based approach and subsequent fine-tuned spectroscopic fitting procedure
to determine the stellar and wind parameters of each star. We apply this method
to ultra-violet data from the ULLYSES programme and complementary optical data
from the XShootU collaboration. We also utilise evolutionary models to obtain
the evolutionary masses and compare them to our derived spectroscopic masses.
We derive physical parameters and wind properties of 16 late-O and B
supergiants that span a wide $T_{eff}$ range of 12-30 kK, surface gravity range
$\log{g/cm~s^{-2}}$ of 1.8-3.1, and a mass-loss rate range of
$10^{-7.6}-10^{-5.7}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$. We also compare our results to previous
studies spectroscopic studies of LMC OB stars. We find that our derived
photospheric and wind properties are consistent with multiple previous studies.
For most of our sample, we find that the evolutionary masses and spectroscopic
masses are consistent. Our results do not reproduce a bi-stability jump in any
temperature range, but rather a monotonic decrease in mass-loss rate at lower
temperatures. We obtain a terminal wind velocity-effective temperature relation
for LMC supergiants. We find that our derived mass-loss rates do not agree with
predictions from any of the numerical recipes. This is also the case for the
ratio of the terminal wind velocity to the escape velocity
$v_{\infty}/v_{esc}$, and we derive a $v_{\infty}/v_{esc}$-$T_{eff}$ relation.
We find that wind properties are metallicity dependent from a comparison with a
previous SMC study, and we obtain a new modified wind momentum-luminosity
relation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09129v1,astro-ph.SR

heliosphere should contain a magnetic flux rope (MFR) component, the majority
do not exhibit the expected white-light MFR morphology of a leading edge plus
cavity. This different appearance could be the result of distortion of the
internal magnetic structure, merging with other structures, or simply
projection effects. These factors complicate the interpretation of CMEs. This
complexity is exemplified by a CME observed on 28 March 2022. The event
originated from a single eruption, evolving as a textbook CME in the low corona
but appearing as a complex two-MFR structure in white-light observations. Why?
To answer this question, we performed a multi-view data and modeling analysis
to describe the CME coronal evolution. The thermodynamic MHD model, CORHEL-CME,
helps reveal the magnetic configuration of this CME and also reveals that the
ambient field plays a crucial role in shaping the complex structure of the CME
during early evolution. Our research underscores the importance of integrating
multiview observations with physics-based models to gain a deeper insight into
the development of complex CMEs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08820v1,astro-ph.SR

plausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent
learning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two
critical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good
neuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While
extensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains
underexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known
neuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically
plausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation
and has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can
achieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time
(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model
architecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in
determining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we
observe that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts
exhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results
underscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible
learning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task
performance and neural data similarity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06904v1,cs.NE
2025-06-02 13:30:39+00:00,Engram Memory Encoding and Retrieval: A Neurocomputational Perspective,['Daniel Szelogowski'],"Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise
mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain
remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram
theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting
physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a
comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with
mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from
cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in
engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how
synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how
sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant
computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and
biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking
neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that
memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of
plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and
computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical
foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into
the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and
treatment of memory-related disorders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01659v1,cs.NE

platforms for psychophysics research. Online experiments make it possible to
evaluate large and diverse populations remotely and quickly, complementing
laboratory-based research. However, developing and running online psychophysics
experiments poses several challenges: i) a high barrier-to-entry for
researchers who often need to learn complex code-based platforms, ii) an
uncontrolled experimental environment, and iii) questionable credibility of the
participants. Here, we introduce an open-source Modular Online Psychophysics
Platform (MOPP) to address these challenges. Through the simple web-based
interface of MOPP, researchers can build modular experiments, share them with
others, and copy or modify tasks from each others environments. MOPP provides
built-in features to calibrate for viewing distance and to measure visual
acuity. It also includes email-based and IP-based authentication, and reCAPTCHA
verification. We developed five example psychophysics tasks, that come
preloaded in the environment, and ran a pilot experiment which was hosted on
the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud. Pilot data collected for these tasks
yielded similar results to those reported in laboratory settings. MOPP can thus
help researchers collect large psychophysics datasets online, with reduced
turnaround time, and in a standardized manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23137v1,q-bio.NC

I: Instrument and acquisition parameters affecting BFP images and their analysis,"['Omer Shavit', 'Hervé Suaudeau', 'Carine Julien', 'Hodaya Klimovsky', 'Natalia Mañas-Chavernas', 'Adi Salomon', 'Martin Oheim']","The back-focal plane (BFP) of a high-numerical aperture objective contains
the fluoro-phore radiation pattern, which encodes information about the axial

the embedding medium. BFP image acquisition and analysis are common to
conoscopy, k-space imaging, supercritical-angle fluorescence (SAF) and
single-molecule detection, but they are rarely being used in biological
fluorescence. This work addresses a critical gap in quantitative microscopy by
enabling reliable, real-time BFP imaging under low-light conditions and/or

laboratory relaxation curve. Based on the predicted laboratory data, laboratory
data-driven methods can be used for field battery diagnosis and prognosis.
Compared with the field data-driven methods based on massive historical field
data, the proposed method has the advantages of higher accuracy, lower cost,
faster speed, readily available, and no use of private data. The proposed
method is tested using two open-source datasets containing 249 NMC cells. For a
test set containing 76 cells, the mean absolute percentage errors of laboratory
real impedance curve, charge curve, and discharge curve prediction results are
0.85%, 4.72%, and 2.69%, respectively. This work fills the gap between

to enhance performance in biomedical applications. We hypothesized that the
benefits of pathway integration does not arise from its biological relevance,
but rather from the sparsity it introduces. We conducted a comprehensive
analysis of all relevant pathway-based neural network models for predictive
tasks, critically evaluating each study's contributions. From this review, we
curated a subset of methods for which the source code was publicly available.
The comparison of the biologically informed state-of-the-art deep learning
models and their randomized counterparts showed that models based on randomized
information performed equally well as biologically informed ones across
different metrics and datasets. Notably, in 3 out of the 15 analyzed models,
the randomized versions even outperformed their biologically informed
counterparts. Moreover, pathway-informed models did not show any clear
advantage in interpretability, as randomized models were still able to identify
relevant disease biomarkers despite lacking explicit pathway information. Our
findings suggest that pathway annotations may be too noisy or inadequately
explored by current methods. Therefore, we propose a methodology that can be
applied to different domains and can serve as a robust benchmark for
systematically comparing novel pathway-informed models against their randomized
counterparts. This approach enables researchers to rigorously determine whether
observed performance improvements can be attributed to biological insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04300v1,q-bio.QM

Specifically, DALIP optimizes CLIP models by matching the similarity between
feature distribution of image-text pairs instead of the original [cls] token,

implementation of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) remains costly and complex,

we introduce Claude-Light, a lightweight, remotely accessible instrument
designed for prototyping automation algorithms and machine learning workflows.
Claude-Light integrates a REST API, a Raspberry Pi-based control system, and an
RGB LED with a photometer that measures ten spectral outputs, providing a
controlled but realistic experimental environment. This device enables users to
explore automation at multiple levels, from basic programming and experimental
design to machine learning-driven optimization. We demonstrate the application
of Claude-Light in structured automation approaches, including traditional
scripting, statistical design of experiments, and active learning methods.
Additionally, we explore the role of large language models (LLMs) in laboratory
automation, highlighting their use in instrument selection, structured data
extraction, function calling, and code generation. While LLMs present new
opportunities for streamlining automation, they also introduce challenges
related to reproducibility, security, and reliability. We discuss strategies to
mitigate these risks while leveraging LLMs for enhanced efficiency in
self-driving laboratories. Claude-Light provides a practical and accessible
platform for students and researchers to develop automation skills and test
algorithms before deploying them in larger-scale SDLs. By lowering the barrier

compromising the stability and interpretability of selected variables. To
address these problems, we introduce the Multi-View Orthogonal Projection
Regression (MVOPR), a novel approach for variable selection in multi-omics

effectively mitigates the correlations, allowing penalized regression models to
operate on independent components. Through simulations under both

exercises that probe the boundaries of authentication mechanisms, to AI
research processing copyrighted material, to platform research measuring the
behavior of algorithms and users. U.S.-based computer security research is no
stranger to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA) in a relationship that is still evolving through case law,
research practices, changing policies, and legislation.
  Amid the landscape computer scientists, lawyers, and policymakers have
learned to navigate, anti-fraud laws are a surprisingly under-examined
challenge for computer science research. Fraud brings separate issues that are
not addressed by the methods for navigating CFAA, DMCA, and Terms of Service
that are more familiar in the computer security literature. Although anti-fraud
laws have been discussed to a limited extent in older research on phishing
attacks, modern computer science researchers are left with little guidance when
it comes to navigating issues of deception outside the context of pure
laboratory research.
  In this paper, we analyze and taxonomize the anti-fraud and deception issues
that arise in several areas of computer science research. We find that, despite
the lack of attention to these issues in the legal and computer science
literature, issues of misrepresented identity or false information that could
implicate anti-fraud laws are actually relevant to many methodologies used in
computer science research, including penetration testing, web scraping, user
studies, sock puppets, social engineering, auditing AI or socio-technical
systems, and attacks on artificial intelligence. We especially highlight the
importance of anti-fraud laws in two research fields of great policy
importance: attacking or auditing AI systems, and research involving legal
identification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02767v2,cs.CY

to handle complex biological data and theoretical models in photosynthesis
research and often fail to provide accurate scientific contexts. Therefore,
this study proposed a photosynthesis research assistant (PRAG) based on
OpenAI's GPT-4o with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and prompt
optimization. Vector databases and an automated feedback loop were used in the
prompt optimization process to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the
responses to photosynthesis-related queries. PRAG showed an average improvement
of 8.7% across five metrics related to scientific writing, with a 25.4%
increase in source transparency. Additionally, its scientific depth and domain
coverage were comparable to those of photosynthesis research papers. A
knowledge graph was used to structure PRAG's responses with papers within and
outside the database, which allowed PRAG to match key entities with 63% and

However, discovery and development of therapeutic antibodies remains a
time-consuming and expensive process. Recent advancements in machine learning

revolutionizing antibody discovery and optimization. In particular, models that
predict antibody biological activity enable in-silico evaluation of binding and
functional properties; such models can prioritize antibodies with the highest
likelihoods of success in costly and time-intensive laboratory testing
procedures. We here explore an AI model for predicting the binding and receptor
blocking activity of antibodies against influenza A hemagglutinin (HA)

biologics discovery to predict antibody-antigen interactions using only
sequence information. To evaluate the model's performance, we tested it under
various data split conditions to mimic real-world scenarios.
  Our models achieved an AUROC $\geq$ 0.91 for predicting the activity of
existing antibodies against seen HAs and an AUROC of 0.9 for unseen HAs. For
novel antibody activity prediction, the AUROC was 0.73, which further declined
to 0.63-0.66 under stringent constraints on similarity to existing antibodies.
These results demonstrate the potential of AI foundation models to transform

has led to significant advancements in odor detection and classification.
Inspired by the intricate mechanisms of natural olfaction, researchers are
developing sophisticated systems that mimic the functionality of biological
olfactory pathways. These systems utilize high-density chemoresistive sensor
arrays (HCSA) combined with advanced computational techniques, such as
FPGA-accelerated glomerular convergence circuits (FGCC) and hierarchical graph
neural networks (HGNN). This bioinspired approach enables real-time adaptive
responses to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), enhancing the accuracy and
efficiency of odor identification. At the core of these innovations is the
multiparametric sigmoidal sensor activation (MPSA), which quantifies VOCs by
leveraging the diverse responses of sensor arrays. The implementation of
lateral inhibition via programmable synaptic crossbars (LIPSC) further refines
odor processing by mimicking neural interactions found in biological systems.
Additionally, temporal self-organizing maps (TSOM) facilitate dynamic
clustering of odor patterns, allowing for a nuanced understanding of complex
odor environments. A novel aspect of this research lies in the Grassmannian
manifold embedding (GME) of odor profiles, which provides a mathematical
framework for representing and analyzing the multidimensional nature of odors.
Coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-optimized feedback (HMC-FB), this system

in the last years as an experimental technique to understand the collective
behavior of neuronal assemblies in relation to their underlying connectivity.
An inherent obstacle in the design of such engineered systems is the difficulty
to predict the dynamic repertoire of the emerging network and its dependence on
experimental variables. To fill this gap, and inspired on recent experimental
studies, here we present a numerical model that aims at, first, replicating the
anisotropies in connectivity imprinted through engineering, to next realize the
collective behavior of the neuronal network and make predictions. We use
experimentally measured, biologically-realistic data combined with the
Izhikevich model to quantify the dynamics of the neuronal network in relation
to tunable structural and dynamical parameters. These parameters include the
synaptic noise, strength of the imprinted anisotropies, and average axon
lengths. The latter are involved in the simulation of the development of
neurons in vitro. We show that the model captures the behavior of engineered
neuronal cultures, in which a rich repertoire of activity patterns emerge but
whose details are strongly dependent on connectivity details and noise. Results
also show that the presence of connectivity anisotropies substantially improves
the capacity of reconstructing structural connectivity from activity data, an
aspect that is important in the quest for understanding the
structure-to-function relationship in neuronal networks. Our work provides the

inactive site stores a molecule in order to release it following a reaction,
when the neighboring catalytic site is empty. In the second regime, the

severely impacting natural resources and risks by depleting water resources and
diminishing agricultural yields. Under climate change, accurately predicting
drought is critical for mitigating drought-induced risks. However, the
intricate interplay among the physical and biological drivers that regulate
droughts limits the predictability and understanding of drought, particularly
at a subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale. While deep learning has been
demonstrated with potential in addressing climate forecasting challenges, its
application to drought prediction has received relatively less attention. In
this work, we propose a new dataset, DroughtSet, which integrates relevant
predictive features and three drought indices from multiple remote sensing and
reanalysis datasets across the contiguous United States (CONUS). DroughtSet
specifically provides the machine learning community with a new real-world
dataset to benchmark drought prediction models and more generally, time-series
forecasting methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatial-temporal model SPDrought
to predict and interpret S2S droughts. Our model learns from the spatial and
temporal information of physical and biological features to predict three types
of droughts simultaneously. Multiple strategies are employed to quantify the
importance of physical and biological features for drought prediction. Our
results provide insights for researchers to better understand the
predictability and sensitivity of drought to biological and physical
conditions. We aim to contribute to the climate field by proposing a new tool
to predict and understand the occurrence of droughts and provide the AI
community with a new benchmark to study deep learning applications in climate
science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15075v1,cs.LG

understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on
magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the

biological research has surged in recent years. These models can be text-based

benchmarking approach that, instead of evaluating the models directly,
leverages entity representation vectors from each model and trains simple
predictive models for each benchmarking task. This ensures that all types of
models are evaluated using the same input and output types. Here we focus on
gene properties collected from professionally curated bioinformatics databases.
These gene properties are categorized into five major groups: genomic

nanorobots, allowing them to detect and interact with cancer cells through
biomarker analysis. This study presents a new reinforcement learning (RL)
framework for optimizing nanorobot navigation in complex biological

gradients of surrounding biomarkers. We utilize a computer simulation model to
explore the behavior of nanorobots in a three-dimensional space with cancer

movement strategies based on real-time biomarker concentration data, enabling
nanorobots to autonomously navigate to cancerous tissues for targeted drug
delivery. This research lays the groundwork for future laboratory experiments
and clinical applications, with implications for personalized medicine and less
invasive cancer treatments. The integration of intelligent nanorobots could
revolutionize therapeutic strategies, reducing side effects and enhancing
treatment effectiveness for cancer patients. Further research will investigate

mechanisms tied to their intricate stereochemistry. Subtle stereochemical
differences, such as those between the anomers maltose and cellobiose, lead to
distinct properties due to their differing glycosidic bonds; the former is
digestible by humans, while the latter is not. This underscores the importance
of precise structural determination of individual carbohydrate molecules for
deeper functional insights. However, their structural complexity and
conformational flexibility, combined with the high spatial resolution needed,
have hindered direct imaging of carbohydrate stereochemistry. Here, we employ
non-contact atomic force microscopy integrated with a data-efficient,
multi-fidelity structure search approach accelerated by machine learning
integration to determine the precise 3D atomic coordinates of two carbohydrate
anomers. We observe that glycosidic bond stereochemistry regulates on-surface
chiral selection in carbohydrate self-assemblies. The reconstructed models,
validated against experimental data, provide reliable atomic-scale structural
evidence, uncovering the origin of on-surface chirality from carbohydrate
anomerism. Our study confirms that nc-AFM is a reliable technique for
real-space discrimination of carbohydrate stereochemistry at the

screen a large number of compounds in search of effective drugs. These
experiments are expensive, so one might hope to reduce their cost by only
experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the
remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential
subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in
order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our
key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the
prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for
the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively
easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system
performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use
of a confidence-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging
examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that interrupts
the acquisition loop when it is sufficiently confident that the system has
reached the target performance. Our empirical studies on image and molecular
datasets, as well as a real-world large-scale biological assay, show that
active learning for inference set design leads to significant reduction in
experimental cost while retaining high system performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19631v4,cs.LG

conventional dose rates (DR) with hypofractionated schemes. While considerable
biological research is needed to understand the FLASH effect and determine the
FLASH modifying factors (FMF) for individual OARs, exploratory treatment
planning studies have also emerged. This study aims to show that spinal
metastases are candidate treatment sites likely to benefit from this phenomenon
and establish the requisite FMFs to achieve the protective FLASH effect. A
conformal FLASH Proton SBRT plan was generated for a patient with spine
metastasis in a research version of RayStation11B (RaySearch laboratories AB,
Stockhom) on an IBA Proteus Plus system. Two oblique posterior beams were used
in the plan. The prescribed dose to the CTV was set according to 3 different
fractionation regimens: 5 fractions (fx) of 7 Gy, 8 fx of 5 Gy, and 10 fx of
4.2 Gy. Spot filtering and sorting techniques were applied to maximize the 5%
pencil beam scanning DR in the spinal cord (SC). The FLASH effect was assumed
to be observed within irradiated regions above 40 Gy/s and 4 Gy per fraction.
The generated plans successfully ensure robust target coverage in each
fraction. The volume of SC that does not comply with the clinical goal adheres
to the FLASH effect conditions in each fraction. Depending on the
aforementioned fractionation schemes used, a FMF of approximately 0.6 to 0.8 is
necessary to enable such treatment in FLASH conditions. Our study demonstrates
the potential of hypofractionated FLASH PT in treating spine metastasis while

urged us to fathom the systematic architecture of biological networks and their
evolutionary advantages. We found the dissipation of biological dissipative
networks is highly related to their structure. By interrogating these
well-adapted networks, we find that the energy producing module is relatively
isolated in all situations. We applied evolutionary simulation and analysis on
premature networks of classic dissipative networks, namely kinetic
proofreading, activator-inhibitor oscillator and two typical adaptative
response models. We found despite that selection was imposed merely on the
network function, the networks tended to decouple high energy molecules as
fuels from the functional module, to achieve higher overall dissipation during
the course of evolution. Furthermore, we find that decoupled fuel modules can
increase the robustness of the networks towards parameter or structure
perturbations. We provide theoretical analysis on the kinetic proofreading

decoupling can guarantee higher dissipation and, in most cases when considering

forgetting, limited capacity, slow iterative learning procedures, low-order
Markov memory, and, most importantly, the inability to represent and generate
multiple valid future possibilities stemming from the same context. Inspired by
biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose
\textit{Predictive Attractor Models (PAM)}, a novel sequence memory

forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in
cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously
learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union
set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an
attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained

analyze neutron flux, energy deposition rates, and Linear Energy Transfer (LET)

celestial mechanical cycles (e.g., seasonal and lunar), but studies on the
origin of life have largely not accounted for such periodic external
environmental variations. We argue that this may be an important omission,
because the signature replication behaviour of life represents temporal memory
in the dynamics of ecosystems, that signifies the absence of mixing properties
(i.e., the dynamics are not fully chaotic), and entrainment onto regular,
periodic external perturbative influences has been proven capable of
suppressing chaos, and thus may bring otherwise unstable chemical reaction sets
into viability, as precursors to abiogenesis. As well, external perturbations
may be necessary to prevent an open dissipative (bio)chemical system from
collapsing into the opposite extreme -- the point attractor of thermal
equilibrium. In short, life may precariously rest on the edge of chaos, and
open-loop periodic perturbation rooted in celestial mechanics (and should be
simulated in laboratory experiments in origin-of-life studies) may help with
the balancing. Such considerations, if pertinent, would also be consequential
to exobiology, e.g., in regard to tidal-locking properties of potential host

bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how
hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how
fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures
in cyanobacteria. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake
samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution
was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that
EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical
resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels
(exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies
experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single
cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the
structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of
colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support
the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of
colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on
the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of
cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural
conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation
could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve
prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and

We define the prediction task as a binary prediction problem of predicting
whether the lab value falls into low or high abnormalities. The model
performance can then be assessed using AUROC.
  Results: Our findings demonstrate promising results in the estimation of
laboratory values related to different organ systems based on a small yet

unfixed-length sequences cannot serve as the input of common data mining
algorithms. Hence, various representation schemes have been developed to
transform DNA sequences into fixed-length numerical representations. However,
these schemes face difficulties in learning high-quality representations due to
the complexity and sparsity of DNA data. Additionally, DNA sequences are
inherently noisy because of mutations. While several schemes have been proposed
for their effectiveness, they often lack semantic structure, making it
difficult for biologists to validate and leverage the results. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{Dy-mer}, an explainable and robust DNA
representation scheme based on sparse recovery. Leveraging the underlying
semantic structure of DNA, we modify the traditional sparse recovery to capture
recurring patterns indicative of biological functions by representing frequent
K-mers as basis vectors and reconstructing each DNA sequence through simple
concatenation. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{Dy-mer} achieves
state-of-the-art performance in DNA promoter classification, yielding a
remarkable \textbf{13\%} increase in accuracy. Moreover, its inherent
explainability facilitates DNA clustering and motif detection, enhancing its
utility in biological research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12051v1,q-bio.GN

the application of centralized large scale hyperparameter optimization. VETE
demonstrated robust accuracy in cancer cell line classification and drug

biological plausibility of backpropagation is questioned due to its
requirements for weight symmetry, global error computation, and dual-phase
training. To address this long-standing challenge, many studies have endeavored
to devise biologically plausible training algorithms. However, a fully

a substantial anisotropy in the electronic structure. Renormalization of
$\sigma(\omega,T)$ occurs as a function of temperature to a coherent Kondo

biology, and are used to build predictive models, discover patterns, and
investigate biological problems. However, models trained on one dataset are
often not generalizable to other datasets from different cohorts or
laboratories, due to differences in the statistical properties of these
datasets. These could stem from technical differences, such as the measurement
technique used, or from relevant biological differences between the populations
studied. Domain adaptation, a type of transfer learning, can alleviate this
problem by aligning the statistical distributions of features and samples among
different datasets so that similar models can be applied across them. However,
a majority of state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods are designed to work
with large-scale data, mostly text and images, while biological datasets often
suffer from small sample sizes, and possess complexities such as heterogeneity
of the feature space. This Review aims to synthetically discuss domain

lead, through accident or misuse, to high-consequence disease outbreaks.
Scientists have carefully considered what types of life sciences research have
the potential for both benefit and risk (dual-use), especially as scientific
advances have accelerated our ability to engineer organisms and create novel

high-consequence risks (those that could cause large-scale harm to the public,
such as pandemics), and that these risks should be evaluated prior to model
deployment so as to allow potential biosafety and/or biosecurity measures.
Scientists' experience with identifying and mitigating dual-use biological

intelligence? If so, why? We frame intelligence as adaptability, and explore
this question using a mathematical formalism of causal learning. We compare
systems by how they delegate control, illustrating how this applies with
examples of computational, biological, human organisational and economic
systems. We formally show the scale-free, dynamic, bottom-up architecture of
biological self-organisation allows for more efficient adaptation than the
static top-down architecture typical of computers, because adaptation can take
place at lower levels of abstraction. Artificial intelligence rests on a
static, human-engineered `stack'. It only adapts at high levels of abstraction.
To put it provocatively, a static computational stack is like an inflexible
bureaucracy. Biology is more `intelligent' because it delegates adaptation down
the stack. We call this multilayer-causal-learning. It inherits a flaw of
biological systems. Cells become cancerous when isolated from the collective
informational structure, reverting to primitive transcriptional behaviour. We
show states analogous to cancer occur when collectives are too tightly

scientific education. Besides the ability to use available instrumentation for
sample characterization, students should also be imparted knowledge in the
steps of instrument development and construction. These concepts can be taught
using the example of lipid vesicle preparation via extrusion. Vesicle extrusion
is a common technique that involves syringes pushing solutions through membrane
filters and is used in fundamental studies on vesicles. Such research is
important to better understand of biological phenomena and drug development.
Well prepared samples are key to successful research. While the manual approach
is very useful to acquire experience, automatic extrusion is more convenient,
and automation often results in better reproducibility. These advantages can be
combined in a simplistic automatic extruder, that does not require advanced
technical skills to be assembled. It can therefore be used by various groups,
ranging undergraduate to graduate students using equipment typically available.
Using this approach, students can acquire different skillsets including coding,
testing, and advanced use of building materials based on their properties.

and human-robot systems, often have serious impacts on pedestrian safety and
social order. A more comprehensive understanding of these systems is needed to
optimize system stability and efficiency. Despite the importance of these
interactions, empirical research in this area remains limited. Thus, in our
study we explore this underresearched area, focusing on scenarios where
nonreciprocity plays a critical role, such as mass stabbings, which pose a
substantial risk to public safety. We conducted the first experiments on this
system and analysed high-accuracy data obtained from these experiments. The
extent of the direct threat zone is determined by the speed of the moving
threat and the radius of danger occurrence. We further categorize potential
threats into direct, adjacent, and rear-view zones, quantifying the level of
threat for pedestrians. Our study revealed that a pedestrian's desired velocity
correlated positively with potential threat intensity, increasing until near
the direct threat zone. An emerging steady state is observed when escape routes
are blocked by moving threats. This deviation affects the density-velocity
relationship, making it distinct from the general relationship. This deviation
signifies unique pedestrian behaviour in the presence of moving threats.
Additionally, the rate of change in the angle for pedestrian motion in various
desired directions is synchronized. This indicates the emergence of collective
intelligence in nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems. As a result, our study
may constitute a pioneering step towards understanding nonreciprocal
interactions in crowd systems through laboratory experiments. These findings
may enhance pedestrian safety and inform not only government crowd management
strategies but also individual self-protection measures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01664v1,physics.soc-ph

microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose
across hosts. This study uses dose-response and within-host microbial infection
models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It
is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial
infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity
and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of
the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the
assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce
the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears
consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for
the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind
heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a within-host microbial growth
model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response
models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging

investigates the experiment replication process to find out what information is
needed to successfully replicate an experiment. Our objective is to propose the
content and structure of laboratory packages for software engineering
experiments. Method: We evaluated seven replications of three different
families of experiments. Each replication had a different experimenter who was,

package structure that addressed these incidents, including docu-ment usability

of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through the adoption of
foundation models (FMs). These AI techniques have rapidly advanced, addressing
historical challenges in bioinformatics such as the scarcity of annotated data
and the presence of data noise. FMs are particularly adept at handling
large-scale, unlabeled data, a common scenario in biological contexts due to
the time-consuming and costly nature of experimentally determining labeled
data. This characteristic has allowed FMs to excel and achieve notable results
in various downstream validation tasks, demonstrating their ability to
represent diverse biological entities effectively. Undoubtedly, FMs have
ushered in a new era in computational biology, especially in the realm of deep
learning. The primary goal of this survey is to conduct a systematic
investigation and summary of FMs in bioinformatics, tracing their evolution,
current research status, and the methodologies employed. Central to our focus
is the application of FMs to specific biological problems, aiming to guide the
research community in choosing appropriate FMs for their research needs. We
delve into the specifics of the problem at hand including sequence analysis,
structure prediction, function annotation, and multimodal integration,
comparing the structures and advancements against traditional methods.
Furthermore, the review analyses challenges and limitations faced by FMs in
biology, such as data noise, model explainability, and potential biases.
Finally, we outline potential development paths and strategies for FMs in
future biological research, setting the stage for continued innovation and
application in this rapidly evolving field. This comprehensive review serves
not only as an academic resource but also as a roadmap for future explorations
and applications of FMs in biology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04286v1,q-bio.QM

robustness, leading to unforeseen behaviors that affect their safety.
Biological neural systems do solve some of these issues already. Unlike
artificial models, biological neurons adjust connectivity based on neighboring
cell activity. Understanding the biological mechanisms of robustness can pave
the way towards building trust worthy and safe systems. Robustness in neural
representations is hypothesized to correlate with the smoothness of the
encoding manifold. Recent work suggests power law covariance spectra, which
were observed studying the primary visual cortex of mice, to be indicative of a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and robustness in representations. Here, we
show that unsupervised local learning models with winner takes all dynamics
learn such power law representations, providing upcoming studies a mechanistic
model with that characteristic. Our research aims to understand the interplay
between geometry, spectral properties, robustness, and expressivity in neural
representations. Hence, we study the link between representation smoothness and
spectrum by using weight, Jacobian and spectral regularization while assessing
performance and adversarial robustness. Our work serves as a foundation for
future research into the mechanisms underlying power law spectra and optimally
smooth encodings in both biological and artificial systems. The insights gained
may elucidate the mechanisms that realize robust neural networks in mammalian
brains and inform the development of more stable and reliable artificial
systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00679v2,cs.NE

niche in super-resolution (SR) microscopy due to its fast imaging speed and low
excitation intensity. However, due to the significantly higher light dose
compared to wide-field microscopy and the time-consuming post-processing
procedures, long-term, real-time, super-resolution observation of living cells
is still out of reach for most SIM setups, which inevitably limits its routine
use by cell biologists. Here, we describe square lattice SIM (SL-SIM) for
long-duration live cell imaging by using the square lattice optical field as
illumination, which allows continuous super-resolved observation over long
periods of time. In addition, by extending the previous joint spatial-frequency
reconstruction concept to SL-SIM, a high-speed reconstruction strategy is
validated in the GPU environment, whose reconstruction time is even shorter
than image acquisition time, thus enabling real-time observation. We have
demonstrated the potential of SL-SIM on various biological applications,
ranging from microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics to the interactions of
mitochondrial cristae and DNAs in COS7 cells. The inherent lower light dose and

paramount significance in the realm of public health, as it serves as a
critical precursor to various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and significantly
contributes to elevated mortality rates worldwide. However, many existing BP
measurement technologies and standards might be biased because they do not
consider clinical outcomes, comorbidities, or demographic factors, making them
inconclusive for diagnostic purposes. There is limited data-driven research

this work, we employed GPT-35-turbo, a large language model (LLM), to
automatically extract the mean and standard deviation values of BP for both
males and females from a dataset comprising 25 million abstracts sourced from
PubMed. 993 article abstracts met our predefined inclusion criteria (i.e.,
presence of references to blood pressure, units of blood pressure such as mmHg,

continuous depth framework of neural ODEs. This allows us to learn the spatial
support of the filters during training, as well as model the continuous
evolution of feature maps, linking DCNs closely to biological models. We show
that DCNs are versatile and highly applicable to standard image classification
and reconstruction problems, where they improve parameter and data efficiency,

subject of intense research across different disciplines ranging from photonics

nature and if so, how nature utilizes them to gain competitive advantage have
remained largely unanswered. Although biological systems feature many examples
of non-reciprocal interactions with the potential to drive non-Hermitian
dynamics, these are often theoretically overlooked and not experimentally
investigated. Here, we demonstrate in an active matter composed of social
animal Caenorhabditis elegans and bacteria, non-Hermitian dynamics, and the
emergence of EPs owing to the nonreciprocal nature of oxygen sensing,
nonequilibrium interfacial current, and bacterial consumption. We observed that
when driven through the EP, the system collectively breaks parity-time (PT)
symmetry leading to traveling waves and arrested phase separation. We further
find that these features enable the collective ability to localize interfaces
between broken and exact PT-phases. Remarkably, this ability provides a strong
evolutionary advantage to animals living in soil. Altogether our results

high-quality embeddings for biological pathway graphs is important for
researchers looking to understand the underpinnings of disease and train

versatile framework for modeling complex systems. When employed to describe
aspects of animal behavior, the complexity of animal movement and
decision-making often requires the use of unique types of effective
interactions between the particles -- notably nonreciprocal effective forces
that do not obey the usual conservation laws of Newtonian mechanics. Here we
review two recent empirically-motivated models, of two very different types of
animal behavior, where the behavior is described in terms of active particles
which interact through nonreciprocal effective forces. The first model
describes the dynamics of animal contests, wherein typically two rivals fight
over a localized resource. The uniquely shaped effective potentials between the
model's 'contestant particles' manifest the adversarial nature of contest
interactions and capture the dynamical essence of contest behavior in space and
time. The second model describes the stabilization of cohesive swarms through
long-range and adaptive gravity-like attraction. This 'adaptive gravity' model
explains the observed mass and velocity profiles of laboratory midge swarms.
These examples demonstrate that theoretical models that use the framework of

approximately 24 hour internal timing system specific to each individual. One
process of particular interest is gene expression, for which several circadian
transcriptomic studies have identified associations between gene expression
during a 24 hour period and an individual's health. A challenge with analyzing
data from these studies is that each individual's internal timing system is
offset relative to the 24 hour day-night cycle, where day-night cycle time is
recorded for each collected sample. Laboratory procedures can accurately
determine each individual's offset and determine the internal time of sample
collection. However, these laboratory procedures are labor-intensive and
expensive. In this paper, we propose a corrected score function framework to
obtain a regression model of gene expression given internal time when the
offset of each individual is too burdensome to determine. A feature of this
framework is that it does not require the probability distribution generating
offsets to be symmetric with a mean of zero. Simulation studies validate the
use of this corrected score function framework for cosinor regression, which is
prevalent in circadian transcriptomic studies. Illustrations with three real
circadian transcriptomic data sets further demonstrate that the proposed
framework consistently mitigates bias relative to using a score function that

states over time enables both biological and artificial networks to represent
and integrate information to make decisions. In the past few decades,
significant multidisciplinary progress has been made in bridging the gap
between how we understand biological versus artificial computation, including
how insights gained from one can translate to the other. Research has revealed
that neurobiology is a key determinant of brain network architecture, which
gives rise to spatiotemporally constrained patterns of activity that underlie
computation. Here, we discuss how neural systems use dynamics for computation,
and claim that the biological constraints that shape brain networks may be
leveraged to improve the implementation of artificial neural networks. To
formalize this discussion, we consider a natural artificial analog of the brain
that has been used extensively to model neural computation: the recurrent
neural network (RNN). In both the brain and the RNN, we emphasize the common

cost over 10 billion. Drug repurposing offers a more time- and cost-effective
alternative. Computational approaches based on biomedical knowledge graph
representations have recently yielded new drug repurposing hypotheses. In this
study, we present a novel, disease-specific hypergraph representation learning
technique to derive contextual embeddings of biological pathways of various
lengths but that all start at any given drug and all end at the disease of
interest. Further, we extend this method to multi-disease hypergraphs. To
determine the repurposing potential of each of the 1,522 drugs, we derive
drug-specific distributions of cosine similarity values and ultimately consider
the median for ranking. Cosine similarity values are computed between (1) all
biological pathways starting at the considered drug and ending at the disease
of interest and (2) all biological pathways starting at drugs currently
prescribed against that disease and ending at the disease of interest. We
illustrate our approach with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and two of its risk
factors: hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We compare each drug's
rank across four hypergraph settings (single- or multi-disease): AD only, AD +
HTN, AD + T2D, and AD + HTN + T2D. Notably, our framework led to the
identification of two promising drugs whose repurposing potential was
significantly higher in hypergraphs combining two diseases: dapagliflozin

Here we review current knowledge at three levels: 1) Could other classes of
chemical structure serve as building blocks for biopolymer structure and
catalysis? Amino acids now seem both readily available to, and a plausible
chemical attractor for, life as we don't know it. Amino acids thus remain
important and tractable targets for astrobiological research. 2) If amino acids
are used, would we expect the same L-alpha-structural subclass used by life?
Despite numerous ideas, it is not clear why life favors L-enantiomers. It seems
clearer, however, why life on Earth uses the shortest possible (alpha-) amino
acid backbone, and why each carries only one side chain. However, assertions
that other backbones are physicochemically impossible have relaxed into
arguments that they are disadvantageous. 3) Would we expect a similar set of
side chains to those within the genetic code? Not only do many plausible
alternatives exist and evidence exists for both evolutionary advantage and
physicochemical constraint for those encoded by life. Overall, as focus shifts
from amino acids as a chemical class to specific side chains used by post-LUCA
biology, the probable role of physicochemical constraint diminishes relative to
that of biological evolution. Exciting opportunities now present themselves for
laboratory work and computing to explore how changing the amino acid alphabet
alters the universe of protein folds. Near-term milestones include: a)
expanding evidence about amino acids as attractors within chemical evolution;
b) extending characterization of other backbones relative to biological

concomitant neural activation. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of
quantum effects such as coherence and entanglement in Posner molecules. We
investigate how these effects are directly dependent on specific parameters

conditions often lead to evolutionary diversification, where at least two
ecotypes emerge from an initially monomorphic population. Empirical evidence
suggests that such ''evolutionary branching'' occurs stochastically, even under
fixed and stable conditions. This stochastic nature is characterized by: (i)
occurrence in a significant fraction, but not all, of experimental settings,
(ii) emergence at widely varying times, and (iii) variable relative abundances
of the resulting subpopulations across experiments. Theoretical approaches to
understanding evolutionary branching under these conditions have been
previously developed within the (deterministic) framework of ''adaptive
dynamics''. Here, we advance the understanding of the stochastic nature of
evolutionary outcomes by introducing the concept of ''stochastic trade-offs''
as opposed to ''hard'' ones. The key idea is that the stochasticity of
mutations occurs in a high-dimensional trait space and this translates into
variability that is constrained to a flexible tradeoff curve. By incorporating
this additional source of stochasticity, we are able to account for the
observed empirical variability and make predictions regarding the likelihood of
evolutionary branching under different conditions. This approach effectively
bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations,

such biosecurity risks: large language models (LLMs) and biological design
tools (BDTs). LLMs, such as GPT-4 and its successors, might provide dual-use

general guidelines, as well as strategies for more specific types of software.
We highlight outstanding issues regarding how communities measure or evaluate
software impact. To get a deeper understanding of current practices for
software evaluations, we performed a survey of participants in the Informatics
Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI). We also investigated software among this community and others
to assess how often infrastructure that supports such evaluations is
implemented and how this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the
software. We find that developers recognize the utility of analyzing software
usage, but struggle to find the time or funding for such analyses. We also find
that infrastructure such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation,
the presence of software health metrics, and clear information on how to
contact developers seem to be associated with increased usage rates. Our
findings can help scientific software developers make the most out of
evaluations of their software.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03255v1,cs.SE

and Scincus scincus, are capable of effectively and efficiently burying
themselves in soil. Biological Organisms employ various locomotion modes,
including coiling and uncoiling motions, asymmetric body twisting, and
undulating movements that generate motion waves. The coiling-uncoiling motion
drives a seed awn to bury itself like a corkscrew, while sandfish skinks use
undulatory swimming, which can be thought of as a 2D version of helical motion.
Studying burrowing behavior aims to understand how animals navigate
underground, whether in their natural burrows or underground habitats, and to
implement this knowledge in solving geotechnical penetration problems.
Underground horizontal burrowing is challenging due to overcoming the
resistance of interaction forces of granular media to move forward. Inspired by
the burrowing behavior of seed-awn and sandfish skink, a horizontal
self-burrowing robot is developed. The robot is driven by two augers and
stabilized by a fin structure. The robot's burrowing behavior is studied in a
laboratory setting. It is found that rotation and propulsive motion along the
axis of the auger's helical shape significantly reduce granular media's
resistance against horizontal penetration by breaking kinematic symmetry or
granular media boundary. Additional thrusting and dragging tests were performed
to examine the propulsive and resistive forces and unify the observed burrowing
behaviors. The tests revealed that the rotation of an auger not only reduces
the resistive force and generates a propulsive force, which is influenced by
the auger geometry, rotational speed, and direction. As a result, the burrowing
behavior of the robot can be predicted using the geometry-rotation-force
relations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01748v1,cs.RO

of multiple imaging modalities to achieve a comprehensive understanding of

functional contrast by imaging only specifically labeled components, especially
in biological samples. However, the achievable structural information on the

contrast of water window soft X-ray microscopy can complement fluorescence
images in a correlative approach ultimately combining nanoscale structural
resolution with functional contrast. However, soft X-ray microscopes are

modern high-power lasers it has become possible to generate sufficient photon
flux from laser-produced plasmas, thus enabling laboratory-based setups. Here,

accelerate scientific activities by humans, including those in the life
sciences. However, computer programs to operate robots should be written to
implement laboratory automation, which requires technical knowledge and skills
that may not be part of a researcher's training or expertise. In the last few
years, there has been remarkable development in large language models (LLMs)
such as GPT-4, which can generate computer codes based on natural language
instructions. In this study, we used LLMs, including GPT-4, to generate scripts
for robot operations in biological experiments based on ambiguous instructions.
GPT-4 successfully generates scripts for OT-2, an automated liquid-handling
robot, from simple instructions in natural language without specifying the
robotic actions. Conventionally, translating the nuances of biological
experiments into low-level robot actions requires researchers to understand
both biology and robotics, imagine robot actions, and write robotic scripts.
Our results showed that GPT-4 can connect the context of biological experiments
with robot operation through simple prompts with expert-level contextual

biologically plausible framework that constitutes separate populations of
exclusively excitatory and inhibitory neurons that adhere to Dale's principle,
and the excitatory pyramidal neurons are augmented with dendritic-like
structures for context-dependent processing of stimuli. We then conduct a
comprehensive study on the role and interactions of different mechanisms

Directed evolution is a widely-used approach for protein sequence design, which

reduced by using machine learning approaches to build a surrogate model of the
protein landscape and conducting in-silico population selection through
model-based fitness prediction. In this paper, we propose a new method based on
Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO), a well-established optimization method,
for protein sequence design. By incorporating Batch BO into the directed

to perform deliberately designed experiments and record brain activity
simultaneously, aiming to understand the brain mechanism underlying cognition.
However, how the results of this protocol can be applied in technology is
seldom discussed. Here, I review the studies on time processing of the brain as
examples of this protocol, as well as two main application areas of
neuroscience (neuroengineering and brain-inspired artificial intelligence).
Time processing is an indispensable dimension of cognition; time is also an
indispensable dimension of any real-world signal to be processed in technology.
So one may expect that the studies of time processing in cognition profoundly
influence brain-related technology. Surprisingly, I found that the results from
cognitive studies on timing processing are hardly helpful in solving practical
problems. This awkward situation may be due to the lack of generalizability of
the results of cognitive studies, which are under well-controlled laboratory
conditions, to real-life situations. This lack of generalizability may be
rooted in the fundamental unknowability of the world (including cognition).
Overall, this paper questions and criticizes the usefulness and prospect of the
above-mentioned research protocol of cognitive neuroscience. I then give three
suggestions for future research. First, to improve the generalizability of
research, it is better to study brain activity under real-life conditions
instead of in well-controlled laboratory experiments. Second, to overcome the
unknowability of the world, we can engineer an easily accessible surrogate of
the object under investigation, so that we can predict the behavior of the

This paper devotes to 1) detecting unanticipated behavior regularities by
conducting a series of laboratory experiments, and 2) improving existing DTD
dynamics theories by embedding the observed behavior regularities into a route
choice model. First, 312 subjects participated in one of the eight
decision-making scenarios and make route choices repeatedly in congestible
parallel-route networks. Second, three route-switching behavior patterns that
cannot be fully explained by the classic route-choice models are observed.
Third, to enrich the explanation power of a discrete route-choice model,
behavioral assumptions of route-dependent attractions, i.e., route-dependent
inertia and preference, are introduced. An analytical DTD dynamic model is
accordingly proposed and proven to steadily converge to a unique equilibrium
state. Finally, the proposed DTD model could satisfactorily reproduce the

the amount of heat released via individual reactions and by which mechanism the
heat is employed for cellular function operations. This review introduces
atomistic simulation tool kits for studying the mechanisms of thermal signaling

amino acids to their melting point and commencing polymerisation to form

aqueous solutions at specific concentrations, allowing them to grow into
microspheres. The peculiar structure of proteinoids composed of linked amino
acids endows them with unique properties, including action-potential like
spiking of electrical potential. These unique properties make ensembles of
proteinoid microspheres a promising substrate for designing future artificial
brains and unconventional computing devices. To evaluate a potential of
proteinoid microspheres for unconventional electronic devices we measure and
analyse the data-transfer capacities of proteinoid microspheres. In

pancake-like regions of dynamically tilting lead halide octahedra (lower
symmetry) that induce longer range intermolecular correlations within the
CH$_3$NH$_3^+$ sublattice. The dynamic local structure can introduce transient
ferroelectric or antiferroelectric domains that increase charge carrier
lifetimes, and strongly affect the halide migration, a poorly understood

composition of their membrane and by restructuring their underlying
cytoskeleton. We present here further studies and extensions of a minimal

polymerization which is recruited to the membrane by the curved protein
complexes. We characterize the phase diagrams of this model, as function of the
magnitude of the active forces, nearest-neighbor protein interactions and the
proteins' spontaneous curvature. It was previously shown that this model can
explain the formation of lamellipodia-like flat protrusions, and here we
explore the regimes where the model can also give rise to filopodia-like
tubular protrusions. We extend the simulation with curved components of both
convex and concave species, where we find the formation of complex ruffled

separate blood cells such as $RBCs$, $WBCs$, and platelets from plasma or
serum. Although centrifugation is a routine procedure in most medical
laboratories, the factors that affect the efficacy of the centrifugation
process have never been studied analytically. In this paper, we examine the
effect of the centrifugation time on the efficacy of the centrifugation process
by studying the dynamics of the blood cells via the well-known Langevin
equation or equivalently, by solving the Fokker-Plank equation. Our result
depicts that the speed of the centrifuge is one of the determinant factors
concerning the efficacy of the centrifugation process. As the angular speed
increases, the centrifugal force steps up and as result, the particles are
forced to separate from the plasma or serum. The room temperature also
considerably affects the dynamics of analyse during centrifugation. Most
importantly, the generation of heat during centrifugation steps up the
temperature within a centrifuge and as a result, not only the stability of the
sample but also mobility of analyse is affected. We show that as the centrifuge
temperature steps up, the velocity of the cells as well as the displacement of
the cell in the fluid decreases. We then study the dynamics of the whole blood
during capillary action where in this case the blood flows upward in a narrow
space without the assistance of external forces. Previous investigations show

cancer genomics research. Existing computational methods, including deep graph
neural networks, fail to exploit the multilayered gene-gene interactions or
provide limited explanation for their predictions. These methods are restricted
to a single biological network, which cannot capture the full complexity of
tumorigenesis. Models trained on different biological networks often yield
different and even opposite cancer gene predictions, hindering their
trustworthy adaptation. Here, we introduce an Explainable Multilayer Graph
Neural Network (EMGNN) approach to identify cancer genes by leveraging multiple
genegene interaction networks and pan-cancer multi-omics data. Unlike
conventional graph learning on a single biological network, EMGNN uses a
multilayered graph neural network to learn from multiple biological networks
for accurate cancer gene prediction. Our method consistently outperforms all
existing methods, with an average 7.15% improvement in area under the
precision-recall curve (AUPR) over the current state-of-the-art method.
Importantly, EMGNN integrated multiple graphs to prioritize newly predicted
cancer genes with conflicting predictions from single biological networks. For
each prediction, EMGNN provided valuable biological insights via both
model-level feature importance explanations and molecular-level gene set

and compressibility differences between a fluid and an object in the fluid. To
name but one application, this acoustic contrast can be exploited using
acoustophoretic systems to isolate cancer cells from a liquid biopsy, such as a
blood sample. Knowing the ACF of a cancer cell represents a crucial step in the
design of acoustophoretic systems for this purpose, potentially allowing the
isolation of circulating cancer cells without labels or contact. For biological
cells the static compressibility is different from the high frequency
counterpart relevant for the ACF. In this study, we started by characterizing
the ACF of low vs. high metastatic cell lines with known associated differences
in phenotypic static E-modulus. The change in the static E-modulus, however,
was not reflected in a change of the ACF, prompting a more in depth analysis of
the influences on the ACF. We demonstrate that static E-modulus increased
biological cells through formaldehyde fixation have an increased ACF.
Conversely static E-modulus decreased biological cells treated with actin
polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D have a decreased ACF. Complementing
these mechanical tests, a numerical COMSOL model was implemented and used to
parametrically explore the effects of cell density, cell density ratios,
dynamic compressibility and therefore the dynamic bulk modulus. Collectively
the combined laboratory and numerical experiments reveal that a change in the
static E-modulus alone might, but does not automatically lead to a change of
the dynamic ACF for biological cells. This highlights the need for a
multiparametic view of the biophysical basis of the cellular ACF, as well as
the challenges in harnessing acoustophoretic systems to isolate circulating
cells based on their mechanical properties alone.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04061v1,q-bio.CB

""two exposures physically interact to bring about the outcome."" A hallmark of
biological interaction is that the total effect, produced when factors act
together, differs from the sum of effects when the factors operate
independently. Epidemiologists construct statistical models to assess
biological interaction. The form of the statistical model determines whether it
is suited to detecting departures from additivity of effects or for detecting
departures from multiplicativity of effects. A consensus exists that biological
interaction should be assessed as a departure from additivity of effects. This
paper compares three statistical models' assessment of a data example that
appears in several epidemiology textbooks to illustrate biological interaction
in a binomial outcome. A linear binomial model quantifies departure from
additivity in the data example in terms of differences in probabilities. It
generates directly interpretable estimates and 95% confidence intervals for
parameters including the interaction contrast (IC). Log binomial and logistic
regression models detect no departure from multiplicativity in the data
example. However, their estimates contribute to calculation of a ""Relative
Excess Risk Due to Interaction"" (RERI), a measure of departure from additivity
on a relative risk scale. The linear binomial model directly produces
interpretable assessments of departures from additivity of effects and deserves
wider use in research and in the teaching of epidemiology. Strategies exist to
address the model's limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.03349v1,stat.AP

greater energy efficiency. Following this biological intuition, we optimized a
spiking policy network (SPN) using a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficient
alternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insects
and communicates through event-based spikes. Inspired by biological research
showing that the brain forms memories by creating new synaptic connections and

technique for coverage expansion, signal enhancement, rank improvement and
blind-zone compensation, thanks to its appealing features including zero energy
consumption, ultra low cost, signaling- and maintenance-free, easy deployment
and full compatibility with existing and future wireless systems. However, a
prevalent understanding for reflection by metal plates is based on Snell's Law,
i.e., signal can only be received when the observation angle equals to the
incident angle, which is valid only when the electrical dimension of the metal
plate is extremely large. In this paper, we rigorously derive a general
reflection model that is applicable to metal reflectors of any size, any
orientation, and any linear polarization. The derived model is given compactly
in terms of the radar cross section (RCS) of the metal plate, as a function of
its physical dimensions and orientation vectors, as well as the wave
polarization and the wave deflection vector, i.e., the change of direction from
the incident wave direction to the observation direction. Furthermore,
experimental results based on actual field measurements are provided to
validate the accuracy of our developed model and demonstrate the great
potential of communications using metal reflectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08626v1,cs.IT

pathology and life-science research, which visualizes the tissue and cellular
structures using chromatic dyes or fluorescence labels to aid the microscopic
assessment of tissue. However, the current histological staining workflow
requires tedious sample preparation steps, specialized laboratory
infrastructure, and trained histotechnologists, making it expensive,
time-consuming, and not accessible in resource-limited settings. Deep learning
techniques created new opportunities to revolutionize staining methods by
digitally generating histological stains using trained neural networks,
providing rapid, cost-effective, and accurate alternatives to standard chemical
staining methods. These techniques, broadly referred to as virtual staining,
were extensively explored by multiple research groups and demonstrated to be
successful in generating various types of histological stains from label-free
microscopic images of unstained samples; similar approaches were also used for
transforming images of an already stained tissue sample into another type of
stain, performing virtual stain-to-stain transformations. In this Review, we
provide a comprehensive overview of the recent research advances in deep
learning-enabled virtual histological staining techniques. The basic concepts
and the typical workflow of virtual staining are introduced, followed by a
discussion of representative works and their technical innovations. We also
share our perspectives on the future of this emerging field, aiming to inspire

substrates based on colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced by laser
ablation of silver granules in pure water that are inexpensive, easy to make,
and chemically stable. Here, the effects of the laser power, pulse repetition
frequency, and ablation duration on the Surface Plasmon Resonance peak of AgNPs
solutions, were used to determine the optimal parameters. Also, the effects of
the laser ablation time on both ablation efficiency and SERS enhancement were
studied. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer
and Raman spectrometer. The Surface Plasmon Resonance peak of AgNP solutions
was centered at 404 nm confirming their synthesis. Using Raman spectroscopy,
they had main bands centered at 196, 568, 824, 1060, 1312 cm-1, 1538 and 2350
cm-1. Their Raman spectral profiles remained constant within the first few days
of storage at room temperature implying chemical stability. The Raman signals
from blood were enhanced when mixed with AgNPs and this depended on colloidal
AgNPs concentration. Using those generated by 12 hrs ablation time, an
enhancement of 14.95 was achieved. Additionally, these substrates had an
insignificant impact on the Raman profiles of samples of rat blood when mixed
with them. The Raman peaks noted were 932, 1064, 1190, 1338, 1410, 1650 and
2122 cm-1. These SERS substrates can be applied to areas such as forensics,
monitoring of the efficacy of drugs, disease diagnostics and pathogen
detection. All this can be achieved by comparing the Raman spectra of the
biological samples mixed with the synthesized SERS substrates for different
samples. Thus, the results on the use of inexpensive, simple-to-prepare Raman
substrates have the possibility of making surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
available to laboratories with scarce resources in developing nations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00939v2,physics.optics

patch forage adaptively in patterns similar to biological foragers, and
approach optimal patch foraging behavior when accounting for temporal

between a finite number of semi-stable states that correspond to behaviors or
decisions. We present here a broad class of dynamical systems that are ideal
for modeling such activity. The models we propose are chaotic heteroclinic
networks with nontrivial intersections of stable and unstable manifolds. Due to
the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitions between states are
seemingly random. Dwell times, exit distributions, and other transition
statistics can be built into the model through geometric design and can be
controlled by tunable parameters. To test our model's ability to simulate
realistic biological phenomena, we turned to one of the most studied organisms,
{\it C. elegans}, well known for its limited behavioral states. We
reconstructed experimental data from two laboratories, demonstrating the
model's ability to quantitatively reproduce dwell times and transition
statistics under a variety of conditions. Stochastic switching between dominant
states in complex dynamical systems has been extensively studied and is often
modeled as Markov chains. As an alternative, we propose here a new paradigm,
namely chaotic heteroclinic networks generated by deterministic rules (without
the necessity for noise). Chaotic heteroclinic networks can be used to model
systems with arbitrary architecture and size without a commensurate increase in
phase dimension. They are highly flexible and able to capture a wide range of
transition characteristics that can be adjusted through control parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10654v1,math.DS

computational models of biological object recognition. Their remarkable success
has helped vision science break new ground and recent efforts have started to
transfer this achievement to research on biological face recognition. In this
regard, face detection can be investigated by comparing face-selective
biological neurons and brain areas to artificial neurons and model layers.
Similarly, face identification can be examined by comparing in vivo and in
silico multidimensional ""face spaces"". In this review, we summarize the first
studies that use DCNNs to model biological face recognition. On the basis of a
broad spectrum of behavioral and computational evidence, we conclude that DCNNs
are useful models that closely resemble the general hierarchical organization
of face recognition in the ventral visual pathway and the core face network. In
two exemplary spotlights, we emphasize the unique scientific contributions of
these models. First, studies on face detection in DCNNs indicate that
elementary face selectivity emerges automatically through feedforward
processing even in the absence of visual experience. Second, studies on face
identification in DCNNs suggest that identity-specific experience and
generative mechanisms facilitate this particular challenge. Taken together, as
this novel modeling approach enables close control of predisposition (i.e.,
architecture) and experience (i.e., training data), it may be suited to inform
long-standing debates on the substrates of biological face recognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06681v3,cs.CV

predictors of continuous responses. These models have been successfully used in
brain research to identify regions in the brain that are associated with
specific human traits, yet their potential to elucidate microbial drivers in
biological phenotypes for microbiome research remains unknown. In particular,
microbial networks are challenging due to their high-dimension and high
sparsity compared to brain networks. Furthermore, unlike in brain connectome
research, in microbiome research, it is usually expected that the presence of
microbes have an effect on the response (main effects), not just the
interactions.
  2. Here, we develop the first thorough investigation of whether Bayesian
Network Regression models are suitable for microbial datasets on a variety of
synthetic and real data under diverse biological scenarios. We test whether the
Bayesian Network Regression model that accounts only for interaction effects
(edges in the network) is able to identify key drivers (microbes) in phenotypic
variability.
  3. We show that this model is indeed able to identify influential nodes and
edges in the microbial networks that drive changes in the phenotype for most
biological settings, but we also identify scenarios where this method performs
poorly which allows us to provide practical advice for domain scientists aiming
to apply these tools to their datasets.
  4. BNR models provide a framework for microbiome researchers to identify
connections between microbes and measured phenotypes. We allow the use of this

Goldman']","Locomotion is typically studied either in continuous media where bodies and
legs experience forces generated by the flowing medium, or on solid substrates
dominated by friction. In the former, centralized coordination is believed to
facilitate appropriate slipping through the medium for propulsion. In the
latter, slip is often assumed minimal and thus avoided via decentralized
controls. We discover in laboratory experiments that terrestrial locomotion of
a meter scale multi-segmented/legged robophysical model resembles undulatory
fluid swimming. Experiments varying waves of limb stepping and body bending
reveal how these parameters result in effective terrestrial locomotion despite
seemingly ineffective isotropic frictional contacts. Dissipation dominates over
inertial effects in this macroscopic-scaled regime, resulting in essentially
geometric locomotion akin to microscopic-scale swimming. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the high-dimensional multi-segmented/legged dynamics can be
simplified to a centralized low-dimensional model, which reveals an effective
Resistive Force Theory with an acquired viscous drag anisotropy. We extend our
low-dimensional, geometric analysis to illustrate how body undulation can aid
performance in non-flat obstacle-rich terrains and also use the scheme to
quantitatively model how body undulation affects performance of biological
centipede locomotion (the desert centipede S. polymorpha) moving at relatively
high speeds (~0.5 body lengths/sec). Our results could facilitate control of

micelles or can reversibly aggregate as a function of pH. The transitions are
often remarkably sharp. We show that these cooperative transitions occur by a
competition between two or more conformational states and can be explained
within the framework of Monod - Wymann - Changeux (MWC) theory that was
originally formulated for allosteric interactions. Here we focus on the
pH-dependent destabilization and permeation of bilayer membranes by HPE. We
formulate the general conditions that lead to sharp conformational transitions

Traubert', 'Christopher J. O Connell', 'Ryan C. Turner', 'Matthew J. Robson']","With the evolution of modern warfare and the increased use of improvised
explosive devices (IEDs), there has been an increase in blast-induced traumatic
brain injuries (bTBI) among military personnel and civilians. The increased
prevalence of bTBI necessitates bTBI models that result in a properly scaled
injury for the model organism being used. The primary laboratory model for bTBI
is the shock tube, wherein a compressed gas ruptures a thin membrane,
generating a shockwave. To generate a shock wave that is properly scaled from
human to rodent subjects the shock wave must have a short duration and high
peak overpressure while fitting a Friedlander waveform, the ideal
representation of a blast wave. A large variety of factors have been
experimentally characterized in attempts to create an ideal waveform, however
we found current research on the gas composition being used to drive shock wave
formation to be lacking. To better understand the effect the driver gas has on
the waveform being produced, we utilized a previously established murine shock
tube bTBI model in conjunction with several distinct driver gasses. In
agreement with previous findings, helium produced a shock wave most closely
fitting the Friedlander waveform in contrast to the plateau-like waveforms
produced by some other gases. The peak pressure at the exit of the shock tube
and 5 cm from the exit have a strong negative correlation with the density of
the gas being used: helium the least dense gas used produces the highest peak
overpressure. Density of the driver gas also exerts a strong positive effect on
the duration of the shock wave, with helium producing the shortest duration
wave. Due to its ability to produce a Friedlander waveform and produce a
waveform following proper injury scaling guidelines, helium is an ideal gas for
use in shock tube models for bTBI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04106v1,q-bio.QM

decoding, where researchers seek to understand the mapping between mental
states (e.g., perceiving fear or joy) and brain activity by identifying those
brain regions (and networks) whose activity allows to accurately identify
(i.e., decode) these states. Once a DL model has been trained to accurately
decode a set of mental states, neuroimaging researchers often make use of
interpretation methods from explainable artificial intelligence research to
understand the model's learned mappings between mental states and brain
activity. Here, we compare the explanation performance of prominent
interpretation methods in a mental state decoding analysis of three functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets. Our findings demonstrate a gradient
between two key characteristics of an explanation in mental state decoding,
namely, its biological plausibility and faithfulness: interpretation methods
with high explanation faithfulness, which capture the model's decision process
well, generally provide explanations that are biologically less plausible than
the explanations of interpretation methods with less explanation faithfulness.
Based on this finding, we provide specific recommendations for the application

hearing aid users. Being able to measure loudness perception correctly in the
clinic is essential for fitting hearing aids. For this, experiments in the
clinic should be able to reflect and capture loudness perception as in
everyday-life situations. Little research has been done comparing loudness
perception in the field and in the laboratory. Design: Participants rated the
loudness in the field and in the laboratory of 36 driving actions done by four
different vehicles. The field measurements were done in a restricted street and
recorded with a 360deg camera and a tetrahedral microphone. The recorded
stimuli, which are openly accessible, were presented in three different
conditions in the laboratory: 360deg video recordings with a head-mounted
display, video recordings with a desktop monitor, and audio-only. Sample:
Thirteen normal-hearing participants and 18 hearing-impaired participants
participated in the study. Results: The driving actions were rated
significantly louder in the laboratory than in the field for the audio-only
condition. These loudness rating differences were bigger for louder sounds in
two laboratory conditions, i.e., the higher the sound level of a driving action
was the more likely it was to be rated louder in the laboratory. There were no

into a pixelwise depth map from the same camera view. It is fundamentally
ill-posed due to missing information: any single image can have been taken from
many possible 3D scenes. Part of the MDE task is, therefore, to learn which
visual cues in the image can be used for depth estimation, and how. With
training data limited by cost of annotation or network capacity limited by
computational power, this is challenging. In this work we demonstrate that
explicitly injecting visual cue information into the model is beneficial for
depth estimation. Following research into biological vision systems, we focus
on semantic information and prior knowledge of object sizes and their
relations, to emulate the biological cues of relative size, familiar size, and
absolute size. We use state-of-the-art semantic and instance segmentation
models to provide external information, and exploit language embeddings to
encode relational information between classes. We also provide a prior on the
average real-world size of objects. This external information overcomes the
limitation in data availability, and ensures that the limited capacity of a
given network is focused on known-helpful cues, therefore improving
performance. We experimentally validate our hypothesis and evaluate the
proposed model on the widely used NYUD2 indoor depth estimation benchmark. The
results show improvements in depth prediction when the semantic information,
size prior and instance size are explicitly provided along with the RGB images,

many have been synthesized in the laboratory on Earth under the conditions
typical for an interstellar environment. Until now, however, only relatively
small molecules of biological interest have been demonstrated to form
experimentally under typical space conditions. Here we prove experimentally
that the condensation of carbon atoms on the surface of cold solid particles
(cosmic dust) leads to the formation of isomeric polyglycine monomers
(aminoketene molecules). Following encounters between aminoketene molecules,
they polymerize to produce peptides of different lengths. The chemistry
involves three of the most abundant species (CO, C and NH$_3$) present in
star-forming molecular clouds, and proceeds via a novel pathway that skips the
stage of amino acid formation in protein synthesis. The process is efficient,
even at low temperatures, without irradiation or the presence of water. The
delivery of biopolymers formed by this chemistry to rocky planets in the
habitable zone might be an important element in the origins of life.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12170v1,physics.bio-ph

evolved a diversity of body plans, from short-bodied and fully-limbed to
elongate and nearly limbless. Such diversity in body morphology is hypothesized
as adaptations to locomotion cluttered terrestrial environments, but the mode
of propulsion -- e.g., the use of body and/or limbs to interact with the
substrate -- and potential body/limb coordination remain unstudied. Here, we
use biological experiments, a geometric theory of locomotion, and robophysical
experiments to comparatively and systematically investigate such dynamics in a
diverse sample of lizard morphologies. Locomotor field studies in short-limb,
elongated lizards (Brachymeles) and laboratory studies of full-limbed lizards
(Uma scoparia and Sceloporus olivaceus) and a limbless laterally undulating
organism (Chionactis occipitalis) reveal that the body wave dynamics can be
described by a combination of traveling and standing waves; the ratio of the
amplitudes of these components is inversely related to limb length. We use
geometric theory to analyze and explain the wave dynamics and body-leg
coordination observations; the theory predicts that leg thrust modulates the
body weight distribution and self-propulsion generation mechanism, which in
turn facilitates the choice of body waves. We test our hypothesis in biological
experiments by inducing the use of traveling wave in stereotyped lizards by
modulating the ground penetration resistance, as well as in controlled
non-biological experiments involving an undulating limbed robophysical model.
Our models could be valuable in understanding functional constraints on the
evolutionary process of elongation and limb reduction in lizards, as well as
advancing robot designs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09312v1,physics.bio-ph

emergent behaviour of quantum systems with a dynamical biologically-inspired
qubits interaction. We use a minimal model of two interacting qubits with an
activity-dependent dynamic interplay as in classical dynamic synapses that
induces the so-called synaptic depression, that is, synapses that present
synaptic fatigue after heavy presynaptic stimulation. Our study shows that in
absence of synaptic depression the 2-qubits quantum system shows typical Rabi
oscillations whose frequency decreases when synaptic depression is introduced,
so one can trap excitations for a large period of time. This creates a
population imbalance between the qubits even though the Hamiltonian is
Hermitian. This imbalance can be sustained in time by introducing a small
energy shift between the qubits. In addition, we report that long-time
entanglement between the two qubits raises naturally in the presence of
synaptic depression. Moreover, we propose and analyse a plausible experimental
setup of our 2-qubits system which demonstrates that these results are robust

sensory systems. Recent work has proposed adding biologically-inspired
components to visual neural networks as a way to improve their adversarial

vulnerability is response stochasticity, like that exhibited by biological

influence the internal representations of standard, adversarially trained, and
biologically-inspired stochastic networks. We find distinct geometric
signatures for each type of network, revealing different mechanisms for

more robust to adversarial perturbations. Geometric analysis of the stochastic
networks reveals overlap between representations of clean and adversarially
perturbed stimuli, and quantitatively demonstrates that competing geometric
effects of stochasticity mediate a tradeoff between adversarial and clean

promise for applications in clinical settings as a rapid, sensitive, and
label-free identification method. These approaches perform well in classifying
data that contains classes that occur during the training phase. However, in
practice, there are always substances whose spectra have not yet been taken or
are not yet known and when the input data are far from the training set and
include new classes that were not seen at the training stage, a significant
number of false positives are recorded which limits the clinical relevance of
these algorithms. Here we show that these obstacles can be overcome by
implementing recently introduced Entropic Open Set and Objectosphere loss
functions. To demonstrate the efficiency of this approach, we compiled a
database of Raman spectra of 40 chemical classes separating them into 20
biologically relevant classes comprised of amino acids, 10 irrelevant classes
comprised of bio-related chemicals, and 10 classes that the Neural Network has
not seen before, comprised of a variety of other chemicals. We show that this

preserving high accuracy on the known ones, dramatically reducing the number of
false positives while preserving high accuracy on the known classes, which will

careers (research productivity, scholarly impact, and collaboration patterns).
It is assumed that the academic age, or the time elapsed from the first
publication, is a good proxy for biological age. In this study, we analyze the
limitations of the proxy in academic career studies, using as an example the
entire population of Polish academic scientists visible in the last decade in
global science and holding at least a PhD (N = 20,569). The proxy works well
for science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM)
disciplines; however, for non-STEMM disciplines (particularly for humanities
and social sciences), it has a dramatically worse performance. This negative
conclusion is particularly important for systems that have only become recently
visible in global academic journals. The micro-level data suggest a delayed
participation of social scientists and humanists in global science networks,
with practical implications for predicting biological age from academic age. We
calculate correlation coefficients, present contingency analysis of academic
career stages with academic positions and age groups, and create a linear
multivariate regression model. Our research suggests that in scientifically

systems. Such a nonlocal coupling arises typically as oscillators are coupled
via an external environment whose characteristic time scale $\tau$ is so small
(i.e., $\tau \rightarrow 0$) that it could be eliminated adiabatically.
Nevertheless, whether the chimera states still exist in the opposite situation
(i.e., $\tau \gg 1$) is unknown. Here, by coupling large populations of
Stuart-Landau oscillators to a diffusive environment, we demonstrate that
spiral wave chimeras do exist in this oscillator-environment coupling system
even when $\tau$ is very large. Various transitions such as from spiral wave
chimeras to spiral waves or unstable spiral wave chimeras as functions of the
system parameters are explored. A physical picture for explaining the formation
of spiral wave chimeras is also provided. The existence of spiral wave chimeras
is further confirmed in ensembles of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators with the
similar oscillator-environment coupling mechanism. Our results provide an
affirmative answer to the observation of spiral wave chimeras in populations of

crewed missions can be supported by available technologies using in situ

radiative transfer model to predict spectrally-resolved solar flux across the
Martian surface. This informed detailed balance calculations for solar cell
devices that identified optimal bandgap combinations for maximizing production
capacity over a Martian year. We then quantified power systems, manufacturing,

revolution in materials science and engineering. These ELMs aim to outperform
current examples of ""smart"", active or multifunctional materials, enabling
countless industrial and societal applications. The ""living"" materials
facilitate unique properties, including autonomy, intelligent responses,
self-repair, and even self-replication. Within this dawning field, most reviews
and documents have divided ELMs into biological ELMs, which are solely made of
cells, and hybrid living materials, which consist of abiotic chassis and living
cells. Considering that the most relevant feature of living material is that
they are made of (or include) living cell colonies and microorganisms, we
consider that ELMs should be classified and presented differently, more related
to life taxonomies than materials science disciplines. Towards solving the
current need for the classification of ELMs, this study presents the first
complete proposal of taxonomy for these ELMs. Here, life taxonomies and
materials classifications are hybridized hierarchically. Once the proposed
taxonomy is explained, its applicability is illustrated by classifying several

underlying connectivity. For this reason, using multilayer networks to model
biological knowledge allows us to formally cover essential properties and
theories in the field, which also raises challenges in visualization. This is
because, in the early days of pathway visualization research, only restricted
types of graphs, such as simple graphs, clustered graphs, and others were
adopted. In this paper, we revisit a heterogeneous definition of biological
networks and aim to provide an overview to see the gaps between data modeling

space that captures the hierarchical structure and provides an average 22%
reduction in embedding RMSE against the best competing geometry. The capacity
of the framework and the significance of these improvements are then
demonstrated devising supervised and unsupervised NeuroSEED approaches to
multiple core tasks in bioinformatics. Benchmarked with common baselines, the

unfolding at broadly separated timescales. However, these two types of
processes are nowadays well documented to much more tightly than traditionally
assumed, especially in communities of microorganisms. With this motivation in
mind, here we scrutinize recent experimental results showing evidence of rapid
evolution of tolerance by lag in bacterial populations that are periodically
exposed to antibiotic stress in laboratory conditions. In particular, the
distribution of single-cell lag times evolves its average value to
approximately fit the antibiotic-exposure time. Moreover, the distribution
develops right skewed heavy tails, revealing the presence of individuals with
anomalously large lag times. Here, we develop a parsimonious individual-based
model mimicking the actual demographic processes of the experimental setup.
Individuals are characterized by a single phenotypic trait: their intrinsic lag
time, which is transmitted with variation to the progeny. The model (in a
version in which the amplitude of phenotypic variations grows with the
parent\'s lag time) is able to reproduce quite well the key empirical
observations. Furthermore, we develop a general mathematical framework allowing
us to describe with good accuracy the properties of the stochastic model by
means of a macroscopic equation, which generalizes the Crow Kimura equation in
population genetics. From a broader perspective, this work represents a
benchmark for the mathematical framework designed to tackle much more general
eco-evolutionary problems, thus paving the road to further research avenues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08416v2,q-bio.PE

homochirality - the specific molecular handedness of biomolecules - is a

interdisciplinary research, by exploring fundamental physics, chemistry,

homochirality in the context of astrophysics and particle physics. The weak
force, one of the fundamental forces operating in nature, is parity-violating.
On Earth, at ground level, most of our cosmic radiation dose comes from
polarized muons formed in a decay involving the weak force. We discuss how the
magnetic polarization is transmitted in cosmic showers within several different

values have been successfully applied to biological networks to study their
global dynamic behavior. Boolean models in particular have been used
extensively. However, multi-state models have also emerged as effective
computational tools for the analysis of complex mechanisms underlying
biological networks. Models in which variables assume more than two discrete
states provide greater resolution, but this scheme introduces discontinuities.
In particular, variables can increase or decrease by more than one unit in one
time step. This can be corrected, without changing fixed points of the system,
by applying an additional rule to each local activation function. On the other
hand, if one is interested in cyclic attractors of their system, then this rule
can potentially introduce new cyclic attractors that were not observed
previously. This article makes some advancements in understanding the state
space dynamics of multi-state network models with a synchronous update schedule

rise to a variety of novel phenomena and fascinating applications. As research
on plasmonics has emerged from the optics and solid-state communities, most
laboratories employ top-down lithography to implement their nanophotonic

self-assembled DNA nanostructures as scaffolds for creating advanced plasmonic

nucleic acid sequences and allows for the nanometer-precise organization of
organic molecules but also for the arrangement of inorganic particles in space.

growing consensus that Linux containers are a promising solution. However,
existing container build solutions require root privileges and cannot be used

low-privilege containers. We detail relevant Linux kernel features, propose a
new taxonomy of container privilege, and compare two open-source

development process to examine the evolution of MAPs. Subsequently we present
our approach to laboratory automation in materials science. We introduce AMANDA

of biological forms, from a fertilized egg to a functioning embryo, remains a
central challenge to applied physics and theoretical biology. Rather than refer
to principles of self-organization and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to
describe a developing embryo from its active cellular constituents, a purely
geometric theory is constructed that references the properties of the ambient
space that the embryo occupies. In 1975 the Fields laureate Ren\'{e} Thom
developed a system of techniques and local dynamical models that are capable of
reconstructing the local dynamic of an embryo at each new growth event of the
system. Each new growth event (the development of a limb, for example) is a
topological change in the dynamic of the system that can be classified only
according to the properties of space. The local models can be non-conservative
flows with robust attractor behavior that serve as organizing centers for
systems development. Hamiltonian flows can also be considered with novel,
self-reproducing vague attractor behavior. The set of growth events become an
unfolding space related to the differentiable manifold of states. The set of
growth events, which Thom refers to as the catastrophe set, has special
algebraic properties which permit these models to be low dimensional--the local
model contains few parameters. We present Thom's work as a research program
outlining a framework for the construction of these local models, and,
ultimately, the synthesis of these models into a full theoretical description

samples traditionally sacrifices computational efficiency and processing time
for physical model accuracy and reconstruction quality. This trade-off hinders
the rapid analysis of living, dynamic biological samples that are often of
greatest interest to biological research. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by
combining annular intensity diffraction tomography (aIDT) with an
approximant-guided deep learning framework. Using a novel physics model
simulator-based learning strategy trained entirely on natural image datasets,
we show our network can robustly reconstruct complex 3D biological samples of
arbitrary size and structure. This approach highlights that large-scale
multiple-scattering models can be leveraged in place of acquiring experimental
datasets for achieving highly generalizable deep learning models. We devise a
new model-based data normalization pre-processing procedure for homogenizing
the sample contrast and achieving uniform prediction quality regardless of
scattering strength. To achieve highly efficient training and prediction, we
implement a lightweight 2D network structure that utilizes a multi-channel
input for encoding the axial information. We demonstrate this framework's
capabilities on experimental measurements of epithelial buccal cells and
Caenorhabditis elegans worms. We highlight the robustness of this approach by
evaluating dynamic samples on a living worm video, and we emphasize our
approach's generalizability by recovering algae samples evaluated with

to the rise of artificial neural networks, which are architectures inspired by
their neurological counterpart in the brain. Through the years, this dualism
between AI and neuroscience has brought immense benefits to both fields,
allowing neural networks to be used in dozens of applications. These networks
use an efficient implementation of reverse differentiation, called
backpropagation (BP). This algorithm, however, is often criticized for its
biological implausibility (e.g., lack of local update rules for the
parameters). Therefore, biologically plausible learning methods that rely on
predictive coding (PC), a framework for describing information processing in
the brain, are increasingly studied. Recent works prove that these methods can
approximate BP up to a certain margin on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and
asymptotically on any other complex model, and that zero-divergence inference
learning (Z-IL), a variant of PC, is able to exactly implement BP on MLPs.
However, the recent literature shows also that there is no biologically
plausible method yet that can exactly replicate the weight update of BP on
complex models. To fill this gap, in this paper, we generalize (PC and) Z-IL by
directly defining them on computational graphs, and show that it can perform
exact reverse differentiation. What results is the first biologically plausible

Sciences. Traditional predictions use statistical information on recurrence
intervals, but those predictions are not accurate enough. In a recent paper, a
machine learning approach was proposed and applied to data of laboratory
earthquakes. The machine learning algorithm utilizes continuous measurements of
radiated energy through acoustic emissions and the authors were able to
successfully predict the timing of laboratory earthquakes. Here, we reproduced
their model which was applied to a gouge layer of glass beads and applied it to
a data set obtained using a gouge layer of salt. In this salt experiment
different load point velocities were set, leading to variable recurrence times.
The machine learning technique we use is called random forest and uses the
acoustic emissions during the interseismic period. The random forest model
succeeds in making a relatively reliable prediction for both materials, also
long before the earthquake. Apparently there is information in the data on the
timing of the next earthquake throughout the experiment. For glass beads energy
is gradually and increasingly released whereas for salt energy is only released
during precursor activity, therefore the important features used in the
prediction are different. We interpret the difference in results to be due to
the different micromechanics of slip. The research shows that a machine
learning approach can reveal the presence of information in the data on the
timing of unstable slip events (earthquakes). Further research is needed to
identify the responsible micromechanical processes which might be then be used
to extrapolate to natural conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06669v1,physics.geo-ph

and reuse. In recent years, the scientific community and the general public
became increasingly aware of the reproducibility crisis, i.e. the wide-spread
inability of researchers to reproduce published work, including their own.
Scientific research is increasingly focused on the creation, observation,
processing, and analysis of large data volumes. On the one hand, this
transition towards computational and data-intensive science poses new
challenges for research reproducibility and reuse. On the other hand, increased
availability and advances in computation and web technologies offer new
opportunities to address the reproducibility crisis. This thesis reports on
user-centered design research conducted at CERN, a key laboratory in
data-intensive particle physics.
  In this thesis, we build a wider understanding of researchers' interactions
with tools that support research documentation, preservation, and sharing. From
a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective the following aspects are
fundamental: (1) Characterize and map requirements and practices around
research preservation and reuse. (2) Understand the wider role and impact of
research data management (RDM) tools in scientific workflows. (3) Design tools
and interactions that promote, motivate, and acknowledge reproducible research
practices. Research reported in this thesis represents the first systematic
application of HCI methods in the study and design of interactive tools for
reproducible science. We advocate the unique role of HCI in supporting,

of tools that enable effective RDM. This thesis paves new ways for interaction

promising method for quantifying longitudinal effects of treatment
interventions in patients with spinal pathologies. However, observed day-to-day
changes might not necessarily be due to a treatment intervention, but can
result from errors related to soft tissue artifacts, marker placement
inaccuracies or biological day-to-day variability. Research question: How
reliable are skin marker-derived three-dimensional spinal kinematics during
functional activities between two separate measurement sessions? Methods:
Twenty healthy adults (11f/9m) were invited to a movement analysis laboratory
for two visits separated by 7-10 days. At each visit, they performed various
functional activities (i.e. sitting, standing, walking, running, chair rising,
box lifting and vertical jumping), while marker trajectories were recorded
using a skin marker-based 10-camera optical motion capture system and used to
calculate sagittal and frontal plane spinal curvature angles as well as
transverse plane segmental rotational angles in the lumbar and thoracic
regions. Between-session reliability for continuous data and discrete
parameters was determined by analyzing systematic errors using one sample
T-tests as well as by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)
and minimal detectable changes (MDCs). Results and Significance: The analysis
indicated high relative consistency for sagittal plane curvature angles during
all activities, but not for frontal and transverse plane angles during walking
and running. MDCs were mostly below 15{\deg}, with relative values ranging
between 10% and 750%. This study provides important information that can serve
as a basis for researchers and clinicians aiming at investigating longitudinal
effects of treatment interventions on spinal motion behavior in patients with
spinal pathologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15956v2,physics.med-ph

effects on biological processes of human diseases. Due to the high
dimensionality of genetic measurements, existing interaction analysis methods
usually suffer from a lack of sufficient information and are still
unsatisfactory. Biological networks have been massively accumulated, allowing
researchers to identify biomarkers from a system perspective by utilizing
network selection (consisting of functionally related biomarkers) as well as
network structures. In the main-effect analysis, network information has been
widely incorporated, leading to biologically more meaningful and more accurate
estimates. However, there is still a big gap in the context of interaction
analysis. In this study, we develop a novel structured Bayesian interaction
analysis approach, effectively incorporating the network information. This
study is among the first to identify gene-gene interactions with the assistance
of network selection for phenotype prediction, while simultaneously
accommodating the underlying network structures. It innovatively respects the
multiple hierarchies among main effects, interactions, and networks. Bayesian
method is adopted, which has been shown to have multiple advantages over some
other techniques. An efficient variational inference algorithm is developed to
explore the posterior distribution. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate

both tinnitus development and perception, and test the tentative models with
brain and behavioral experiments. With a special focus on tinnitus research, we
review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology
and neuroscience, indicating a new research agenda that follows the idea that
experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test
brain-computational models. This view challenges the popular belief, that
tinnitus research is primarily data limited, and that producing large,
multi-modal, and complex datasets, analyzed with advanced data analysis
algorithms, will finally lead to fundamental insights into how tinnitus
emerges. However, there is converging evidence that although modern
technologies allow assessing neural activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in
both, animals and humans, empirical testing one verbally defined hypothesis
about tinnitus after another, will never lead to a mechanistic understanding.
Instead, hypothesis testing needs to be complemented with the construction of
computational models that generate verifiable predictions. We argue, that even

largely lack biological plausibility, the models to be constructed will have to
draw on concepts from these fields, since they have already proven to do well

biological system, how to focus drug development and how to construct more
efficient designs of future laboratory-based in vitro experiments. However,
there is considerable uncertainty about the values of some of the parameters

attempts to tune the parameters so that the model output matches experimental

partial insight into the underlying biological process: the data consist only
of the proportions of cell death and of cells with inclusion bodies at a few

  Developing inference procedures to estimate the model parameters in this

Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc"", LSC) started in the mid-eighties in a railway
tunnel located under the Spanish Pyrenees; since then, it has become an
international multidisciplinary facility equipped with different services for
underground science. The research activity at LSC is about Astroparticle
Physics, dark matter searches and neutrino Physics; but also activities in
Nuclear Astrophysics, Geophysics, and Biology are carried out. The
investigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay has been one of the main
research lines of LSC since the beginning. Many unknowns remain in the
characterization of the basic neutrino properties and the study of this rare
decay process requiring Physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics
can shed light on the lepton number conservation, the nature of the neutrinos
as Dirac or Majorana particles and the absolute scale and ordering of the
masses of the three generations. Here, the double beta decay searches performed
at LSC for different emitters and following very different experimental
approaches will be reviewed: from the very first experiments in the laboratory
including the successful IGEX for $^{76}$Ge, which released very stringent
limits to the effective neutrino mass at the time, to the present NEXT
experiment for $^{136}$Xe and future project CROSS (""Cryogenic Rare-event
Observatory with Surface Sensitivity"") for $^{130}$Te and $^{100}$Mo, both
implementing innovative detector technologies to discriminate backgrounds. For
the neutrinoless double beta decay channel and at 90% C.L., IGEX derived a
limit to the half-life of $^{76}$Ge of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.57 \times 10^{25}$ y
while the corresponding expected limits are $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.0\times
10^{26}$ y for $^{136}$Xe from NEXT-100 (for an exposure of 500 kg.y) and
$T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 2.8 \times 10^{25}$ y for $^{100}$Mo from CROSS (for 5 y and
4.7 kg of isotope). Activities related to double beta decays searches carried
out in other underground laboratories have also been developed at LSC and will
be presented too, like the operation of the BiPo-3 detector for radiopurity
measurements of thin sheets with very high sensitivity. For each one of these
experiments, the concept, the experimental set-ups and relevant results will be

pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Many existing computational
drug repurposing methods rely on preclinical data (e.g., chemical structures,
drug targets), resulting in translational problems for clinical trials. In this
study, we propose a clinical connectivity map framework for drug repurposing by
leveraging laboratory tests to analyze complementarity between drugs and
diseases. We establish clinical drug effect vectors (i.e., drug-laboratory test
associations) by applying a continuous self-controlled case series model on a
longitudinal electronic health record data. We establish clinical disease sign
vectors (i.e., disease-laboratory test associations) by applying a Wilcoxon
rank sum test on a large-scale national survey data. Finally, we compute a
repurposing possibility score for each drug-disease pair by applying a dot
product-based scoring function on clinical disease sign vectors and clinical
drug effect vectors. We comprehensively evaluate 392 drugs for 6 important
chronic diseases (e.g., asthma, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.).
We discover not only known associations between diseases and drugs but also
many hidden drug-disease associations. Moreover, we are able to explain the
predicted drug-disease associations via the corresponding complementarity
between laboratory tests of drug effect vectors and disease sign vectors. The
proposed clinical connectivity map framework uses laboratory tests from
electronic clinical information to bridge drugs and diseases, which is
explainable and has better translational power than existing computational
methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework and suggest that our method could help identify drug repurposing
opportunities, which will benefit patients by offering more effective and safer

undermining advances in modern medicine and, if unmitigated, threatens to kill

application, will be developed to allow particle-beam therapy to be delivered
in a completely new regime, combining a variety of ion species in a single
treatment fraction and exploiting ultra-high dose rates. LhARA will be a hybrid
accelerator system in which laser interactions drive the creation of a large
flux of protons or light ions that are captured using a plasma (Gabor) lens and
formed into a beam. The laser-driven source allows protons and ions to be
captured at energies significantly above those that pertain in conventional
facilities, thus evading the current space-charge limit on the instantaneous
dose rate that can be delivered. The laser-hybrid approach, therefore, will
allow the vast ``terra incognita'' of the radiobiology that determines the
response of tissue to ionising radiation to be studied with protons and light
ions using a wide variety of time structures, spectral distributions, and
spatial configurations at instantaneous dose rates up to and significantly

energies between 10MeV and 15MeV. In stage two, the beam will be accelerated

carried out in vitro and in vivo with proton beam energies of up to 127MeV. In
addition, ion beams with energies up to 33.4MeV per nucleon will be available

energy landscape enables electron bifurcation, and we show that it enables
high-efficiency bifurcation with limited short-circuiting (the EB-scheme). The
landscape relies on steep free energy slopes in the two redox branches to
insulate against short-circuiting without relying on nuanced changes in the

Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how
scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research
output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals'
characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on
average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share
reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to
field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most
negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists
reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics
examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved
dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines
similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can
account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce

frequently in nature. Understanding and predicting the behavior of complex
biological systems is dependent on developing effective descriptions and
models. While collective animal systems are characteristically non-equilibrium,
we can employ concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics to motivate the
measurement of material-like properties in laboratory animal aggregates. Here,
we present results from a new set of experiments that utilize high speed
footage of two-dimensional schooling events, particle tracking, and projected
static and dynamic light fields to observe and control the behavior of
negatively phototaxic fish schools ($\textit{Hemigrammus}$ $\textit{bleheri}$).
First, we use static light fields consisting of dark circular regions to
produce visual stimuli that confine the schools to a range of areas. We find
that the school has a maximum density independent of group size, and that the
swim pressure increases linearly with number density, suggesting that
unperturbed schools exist on an isotherm. Next, we use dynamic light fields
where the radius of the dark region shrinks linearly with time to compress the
schools. We find that the effective temperature parameter depends on the
compression time and our results are thus consistent with the school having a
constant heat flux. These findings provide further evidence for the utility of

fields between 250 and 500 MV/m. Such an approach is foreseen to enable a new
generation of photoinjectors with six-dimensional beam brightness beyond the

essential ingredient enabling an ultra-compact XFEL (UC-XFEL). In addition, one
may accelerate these bright beams to GeV scale in less than 10 meters. Such an
injector, when combined with inverse free electron laser-based bunching
techniques can produce multi-kA beams with unprecedented beam quality,

focal planes to be imaged on a single camera chip. This approach requires a

We examine if metadata standards provide elements corresponding to search

algorithms now afford analysis of much larger networks in practical time. We
illustrate the application of ERGM to both an undirected protein-protein

indicate over-representation of triangles in the PPI network, and confirm
results from previous research as to over-representation of transitive
triangles (feed-forward loop) in an E. coli and a yeast regulatory network. We

m$^3$ laboratory chamber, controlled under conditions where no significant air
motion was possible. These launches were elicited by vertical,
downward-oriented electric fields within the chamber, and the motions indicate
clearly that negative electric charge on the ballooning silk, subject to the
Coulomb force, produced the lift observed in each launch. We estimate the total
charge required under plausible assumptions, and find that at least 1.15 nC is
necessary in each case. The charge is likely to be non-uniformly distributed,
favoring initial longitudinal mobility of electrons along the fresh silk during
extrusion. These results demonstrate for the first time that spiders are able
to utilize charge on their silk to attain electrostatic flight even in the
absence of any aerodynamic lift.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02335v3,physics.bio-ph

systems as a guide. However, there is often little interaction between
computational models for emergent communication and biological models of the
emergence of language. Many researchers in language origins and emergent
communication take compositionality as their primary target for explaining how
simple communication systems can become more like natural language. However,
there is reason to think that compositionality is the wrong target on the
biological side, and so too the wrong target on the machine-learning side. As
such, the purpose of this paper is to explore this claim. This has theoretical
implications for language origins research more generally, but the focus here
will be the implications for research on emergent communication in computer
science and machine learning---specifically regarding the types of programmes
that might be expected to work and those which will not. I further suggest an
alternative approach for future research which focuses on reflexivity, rather
than compositionality, as a target for explaining how simple communication
systems may become more like natural language. I end by providing some
reference to the language origins literature that may be of some use to
researchers in machine learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11668v2,cs.LG

more precise estimates of the association between biomarker exposure
measurements and disease risks due to increased sample sizes. However,
biomarker measurements vary significantly across different assays and
laboratories, and therefore calibration of the local laboratory measurements to
a reference laboratory is necessary before pooling data. We propose two methods
that can estimate a nonlinear relationship between biomarker exposure
measurements and disease risks using spline functions with a nested
case-control study design: full calibration and internalized calibration. The
full calibration method calibrates all observations using a study-specific
calibration model while the internalized calibration method only calibrates
observations that do not have reference laboratory measurements available. We
compare the two methods with a naive method whereby data are pooled without
calibration. We find that: (1) Internalized and full calibration methods have
substantially better performance than the naive method in terms of average
relative bias and coverage rate. (2) Full calibration is more robust than
internalized calibration when the size of calibration subsets varies. We apply
our methods to a pooling project with nested case-control study design to
estimate the association of circulating Vitamin D levels with the risk of
colorectal cancer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09254v1,stat.ME

research and led to impressive performance in various difficult tasks. However,
it is still unclear how the brain can perform credit assignment across many
areas as efficiently as backpropagation does in deep neural networks. In this
paper, we introduce a model that relies on a new role for a neuronal inhibitory
machinery, referred to as ghost units. By cancelling the feedback coming from
the upper layer when no target signal is provided to the top layer, the ghost
units enables the network to backpropagate errors and do efficient credit
assignment in deep structures. While considering one-compartment neurons and
requiring very few biological assumptions, it is able to approximate the error
gradient and achieve good performance on classification tasks. Error
backpropagation occurs through the recurrent dynamics of the network and thanks
to biologically plausible local learning rules. In particular, it does not
require separate feedforward and feedback circuits. Different mechanisms for
cancelling the feedback were studied, ranging from complete duplication of the
connectivity by long term processes to online replication of the feedback
activity. This reduced system combines the essential elements to have a working
biologically abstracted analogue of backpropagation with a simple formulation
and proofs of the associated results. Therefore, this model is a step towards
understanding how learning and memory are implemented in cortical multilayer
structures, but it also raises interesting perspectives for neuromorphic
hardware.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08585v1,q-bio.NC

large amounts of data. However, the representations learned in DNNs are
typically hard to interpret, especially in dense layers. One crucial issue of
the classical DNN model such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) is that neurons in
the same layer of DNNs are conditionally independent of each other, which makes
co-training and emergence of higher modularity difficult. In contrast to DNNs,
biological neurons in mammalian brains display substantial dependency patterns.
Specifically, biological neural networks encode representations by so-called
neuronal assemblies: groups of neurons interconnected by strong synaptic
interactions and sharing joint semantic content. The resulting population
coding is essential for human cognitive and mnemonic processes. Here, we
propose a novel Biologically Enhanced Artificial Neuronal assembly (BEAN)
regularization to model neuronal correlations and dependencies, inspired by
cell assembly theory from neuroscience. Experimental results show that BEAN
enables the formation of interpretable neuronal functional clusters and
consequently promotes a sparse, memory/computation-efficient network without

demonstrate that BEAN could also enhance the generalizability of the model when

reported ice adhesion strengths cannot be directly compared between research
groups. This study compares results obtained from testing the ice adhesion
strength on the same surface at two different laboratories, testing two
different types of ice with different ice adhesion test methods at temperatures
of $-10^o$C and $-18^o$C. One laboratory uses the centrifuge adhesion test and
tests precipitation ice and bulk water ice, while the other laboratory uses a
vertical shear test and tests only bulk water ice. The surfaces tested were
bare aluminum and a commercial icephobic coating, with all samples prepared in
the same manner. The results showed comparability in the general trends,
surprisingly, with the greatest differences for bare aluminum surfaces at
temperature $-10^o$C. For bulk water ice, the vertical shear test resulted in
systematically higher ice adhesion strength than the centrifugal adhesion test.
The standard deviation depends on the surface type and seems to scale with the
absolute value of the ice adhesion strength. The experiments capture the
overall trends in which the ice adhesion strength surprisingly decreases from
$-10^o$C to $-18^o$C for aluminum and is almost independent of temperature for
a commercial icephobic coating. In addition, the study captures similar trends
in the effect of ice type on ice adhesion strength as previously reported and

fitting coefficients exist currently. Therefore, the ability of the model
prediction is reduced by the numerous fitting coefficients. Furthermore, the
predicted results of the established models are dependent on the size of the
photobioreactor (PBR), light intensity, flow and concentration field. The
growth mechanism of microalgae has not clearly understood in PBR cultivation.
It is difficult to predict the microalgae growth by theoretical methods, owing
to the aforementioned factors. We developed an exploratory bridging microalgae
growth model to predict the microalgae growth rate in PBRs by using the
nondimensional method which is effectively in fluid dynamics and heat transfer.
The analytical solution of the growth rate was obtained for the parallel flow.
The nondimensional growth rate expressed as function of Reynolds number and
Schmidt number, which can be used for arbitrary parallel flow due to the
solution was expressed as nondimensional quantities. The theoretically
predicted growth rate is compared with the experimentally measured microalgae
growth rate on the order of magnitude. The nondimensional method successfully
applied to the microalgae growth problem for the first time. The general
nondimensional solution can unify the numerous experimental data for different
laboratory conditions, and give a direction for the disorder of the microalgae

sediments along a test tube in one hour in a clinical laboratory. Since
elevated level of ESR is associated with inflammatory diseases, ESR is one of

RBC is explored by modeling the dynamics of the cells as the motion of Brownian
particle moving in a viscous medium. The viscous friction of blood $\gamma$ is
considered to decrease as the temperature of the medium increases \cite{aa1}.
The results obtained in this work show that the ESR increases as the number of
red blood cells (that bind together in the sedimentation process) steps up. The
room temperature also affects the sedimentation rate. As the room temperature
rises up, the ESR steps up. Furthermore the dynamics of the RBC along a
Westergren pipet that is held in an upright position is explored. The exact
analytic result depicts that the velocity of cells increases as the number of
cells that form rouleaux steps up. Since our study is performed by considering

however, there are few R/Bioconductor packages that integrate existing software
tools into a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis and provide fundamental end-to-end

Roehner', 'Stephane Tronche']","Infant mortality, by which we understand the postnatal stage during which
mortality is declining, is a manifestation and embodiment of congenital
abnormalities. Severe defects will translate into death occurring shortly after
birth whereas slighter anomalies may contribute to death much later, possibly
only in adult age. While for many species birth defects would be nearly
impossible to identify, infant mortality provides a convenient global
assessment. In the present paper we examine a broad range of species from
mammals to fish to gastropods to insects. One of the objectives of our
comparative analysis is to test a conjecture suggested by reliability
engineering according to which the frequency of defects tends to increase
together with the complexity of organisms. For that purpose, we set up
experiments specially designed to measure infant mortality. In particular, we
two species commonly used as model species in biological laboratories, namely
the zebrafish Danio rerio and the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. For the
second, whose number of cells is about hundred times smaller than for the
first, we find as expected that the screening effect of the infant phase is of
much smaller amplitude. Our analysis also raises a number of challenging
questions for which further investigation is necessary. For instance, why is
the infant death rate of beetles and mollusks falling off exponentially rather
than as a power law as observed for most other species? A possible research

considerable research interest in quantitative biological cell imaging due to
its ability to not only create excellent label-free contrast, but also supply
valuable physical information regarding the density and dimensions of the
sample with nanometer-scale axial sensitivity. This technique records the
interference pattern between a sample beam and a reference beam, and by
digitally processing it, one can reconstruct the optical path delay between
these beams. Per each spatial point, the optical path delay map is proportional
to the product of the sample physical thickness and the integral refractive
index of the sample. Since the refractive index of the cell indicates its
contents without the need for labeling, it is highly beneficial to decouple
cell physical thickness from its refractive index profile. This manuscript
reviews various approaches of extracting the refractive index from digital
holographic microscopy measurements of cells. As soon as the refractive index
of the cell is available, it can be used for either biological assays or

Logistic principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the commonly used tools
to explore the relationships inside a multivariate binary data set by
exploiting the underlying low rank structure. We re-expressed the logistic PCA
model based on the latent variable interpretation of the generalized linear
model on binary data. The multivariate binary data set is assumed to be the
sign observation of an unobserved quantitative data set, on which a low rank
structure is assumed to exist. However, the standard logistic PCA model (using
exact low rank constraint) is prone to overfitting, which could lead to
divergence of some estimated parameters towards infinity. We propose to fit a
logistic PCA model through non-convex singular value thresholding to alleviate
the overfitting issue. An efficient Majorization-Minimization algorithm is
implemented to fit the model and a missing value based cross validation (CV)
procedure is introduced for the model selection. Our experiments on realistic
simulations of imbalanced binary data and low signal to noise ratio show that
the CV error based model selection procedure is successful in selecting the
proposed model. Furthermore, the selected model demonstrates superior
performance in recovering the underlying low rank structure compared to models

inferring the internal state of a system from observations of its output. A
related property, structural identifiability, refers to the theoretical
possibility of determining the parameter values from the output. In fact,
structural identifiability becomes a particular case of observability if the
parameters are considered as constant state variables. It is possible to
simultaneously analyse the observability and structural identifiability of a
model using the conceptual tools of differential geometry. Many complex
biological processes can be described by systems of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations, and can therefore be analysed with this approach. The
purpose of this review article is threefold: (I) to serve as a tutorial on
observability and structural identifiability of nonlinear systems, using the
differential geometry approach for their analysis; (II) to review recent
advances in the field; and (III) to identify open problems and suggest new
avenues for research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04525v1,q-bio.QM

operating systems is a difficult task. One of the main sources of the
difficulty is the sheer size and complexity of the operating systems software.
Consequently, some of the solutions adopted in the literature to teach
operating systems laboratory consider smaller and simpler systems, generally
referred to as instructional operating systems. This work continues in the same
direction and is threefold. First, it considers a simpler hardware platform.
Second, it argues that a minimal operating system is a viable option for
delivering laboratories. Third, it presents a laboratory teaching platform,
whereby students build a minimal operating system for an embedded hardware
platform. The proposed platform is called MiniOS. An important aspect of MiniOS
is that it is sufficiently supported with additional technical and pedagogic
material. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach to teach
operating systems laboratories is illustrated through the experience of using
it to deliver laboratory projects in the Operating Systems course at the
University of Northern British Columbia. Finally, we discuss experimental

evaluation of national research systems, generally based on the peer review
approach. They respond to two main needs: stimulating higher efficiency in
research activities by public laboratories, and realizing better allocative
efficiency in government funding of such institutions. However the peer review
approach is typified by several limitations that raise doubts for the
achievement of the ultimate objectives. In particular, subjectivity of
judgment, which occurs during the step of selecting research outputs to be
submitted for the evaluations, risks heavily distorting both the final ratings
of the organizations evaluated and the ultimate funding they receive. These
distortions become ever more relevant if the evaluation is limited to small
samples of the scientific production of the research institutions. The
objective of the current study is to propose a quantitative methodology based
on bibliometric data that would provide a reliable support for the process of
selecting the best products of a laboratory, and thus limit distortions.
Benefits are twofold: single research institutions can maximize the probability
of receiving a fair evaluation coherent with the real quality of their
research. At the same time, broader adoptions of this approach could also
provide strong advantages at the macroeconomic level, since it guarantees
financial allocations based on the real value of the institutions under
evaluation. In this study, the proposed methodology has been applied to the
hard science sectors of the Italian university research system for the period
2004-2006.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08691v1,cs.DL

progress in a wide range of high complexity tasks, might inspire new insights

plausible reinforcement learning rules, like AGREL and AuGMEnT, showed
promising results but focused on shallow networks with three layers. Will these
learning rules also generalize to networks with more layers and can they handle
tasks of higher complexity? We demonstrate the learning scheme on classical and
hard image-classification benchmarks, namely MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, cast
as direct reward tasks, both for fully connected, convolutional and locally
connected architectures. We show that our learning rule - Q-AGREL - performs

wastewater treatment. A pseudo-mechanistic model describing three biological
pathways for nitric oxide (NO) and N2O production was calibrated for mixed
culture biomass from an activated sludge process using laboratory-scale
experiments. The model (NDHA) comprehensively describes N2O producing pathways
by both autotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria.
Extant respirometric assays and anaerobic batch experiments were designed to
calibrate endogenous and exogenous processes (heterotrophic denitrification and
autotrophic ammonium/nitrite oxidation) together with the associated net N2O
production. Ten parameters describing heterotrophic processes and seven for
autotrophic processes were accurately estimated (variance/mean < 25%). The
model predicted NO and N2O dynamics at varying dissolved oxygen, ammonium and
nitrite levels and was validated against an independent set of experiments with
the same biomass. Aerobic ammonium oxidation experiments at two oxygen levels
used for model evaluation (2 and 0.5 mg/L) indicated that both the nitrifier
denitrification (42, 64%) and heterotrophic denitrification (7, 17%) pathways
increased and dominated N2O production at high nitrite and low oxygen
concentrations; while the nitrifier nitrification pathway showed the largest
contribution at high dissolved oxygen levels (51, 19%). The uncertainty of the
biological parameter estimates was propagated to N2O model outputs via Monte
Carlo simulations as 95% confidence intervals. The accuracy of the estimated
parameters resulted in a low uncertainty of the N2O emission factors (4.6 +-
0.6% and 1.2 +- 0.1%).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00004v1,q-bio.QM

traveling duration is equal to zero. In the latter case, any two events that
are separated (in a laboratory reference frame) by an arbitrary finite distance
can be considered as simultaneous ones. So, the photon nonlocal correlation
turns out to be a relative property and may be explained like known twins
paradox in relativity. In such a situation, any standard causal interaction
between the correlated particles is absent in a laboratory reference frame;
however, some specific mutual couple appears between them; this couple is
strictly oscillating without some oriented energy or/and information
transferring. We also motivate the basic hypothesis extension on quantum

biological systems. It occurs when groups of relatively simple components
spontaneously combine to form more complex structures. While such systems have
inspired a large amount of research into designing theoretical models of
self-assembling systems, and even laboratory-based implementations of them,
these artificial models and systems often tend to be lacking in one of the
powerful features of natural systems (e.g. the assembly and folding of
proteins), namely the dynamic reconfigurability of structures. In this paper,
we present a new mathematical model of self-assembly, based on the abstract
Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), called the Flexible Tile Assembly Model (FTAM). In
the FTAM, the individual components are 2-dimensional square tiles as in the
aTAM, but in the FTAM, bonds between the edges of tiles can be flexible,
allowing bonds to flex and entire structures to reconfigure, thus allowing
2-dimensional components to form 3-dimensional structures. We analyze the
powers and limitations of FTAM systems by (1) demonstrating how flexibility can
be controlled to carefully build desired structures, and (2) showing how
flexibility can be beneficially harnessed to form structures which can
""efficiently"" reconfigure into many different configurations and/or greatly
varying configurations. We also show that with such power comes a heavy burden
in terms of computational complexity of simulation and prediction by proving
that, for important properties of FTAM systems, determining their existence is
intractable, even for properties which are easily computed for systems in less

protocols but with varied limitations which limits the reproducibility and the
generalization of the results obtained. In an attempt to overcome these
limitations, some experimental approaches have moved human behavior
experimentation from laboratories to public spaces, where behaviors occur
naturally, and have opened the participation to the general public within the
citizen science framework. Given the open nature of these environments, it is
critical to establish the appropriate protocols to maintain the same data
quality that one can obtain in the laboratories. Here, we introduce Citizen

many medical image analysis tasks. Although image registration is a rather
general concept specialized methods are usually required to target a specific
registration problem. The development and implementation of such methods has
been tough so far as the gradient of the objective has to be computed. Also,
its evaluation has to be performed preferably on a GPU for larger images and
for more complex transformation models and regularization terms. This hinders
researchers from rapid prototyping and poses hurdles to reproduce research
results. There is a clear need for an environment which hides this complexity
to put the modeling and the experimental exploration of registration methods

machinery. In addition, we propose an improved variant of Difference Target
Propagation, another procedure that comes from the same family of algorithms as
LRA-E. We compare our procedures to several other biologically-motivated

biology, physics, and engineering. Community detection identifies candidate
modules as hypotheses, which then need to be validated through experiments,
such as mutagenesis in a biological laboratory. Only a few communities can
typically be validated, and it is thus important to prioritize which
communities to select for downstream experimentation. Here we develop CRank, a
mathematically principled approach for prioritizing network communities. CRank
efficiently evaluates robustness and magnitude of structural features of each
community and then combines these features into the community prioritization.
CRank can be used with any community detection method. It needs only
information provided by the network structure and does not require any
additional metadata or labels. However, when available, CRank can incorporate
domain-specific information to further boost performance. Experiments on many
large networks show that CRank effectively prioritizes communities, yielding a
nearly 50-fold improvement in community prioritization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02411v2,cs.SI

two central dynamical processes in cells and organisms: (i) active motility and
motility control and (ii) self-organized pattern formation. The unifying theme
is the nonlinear dynamics of biological function and its robustness in the
presence of strong fluctuations, structural variations, and external
perturbations. We theoretically investigate motility control at the cellular
scale, using cilia and flagella as ideal model system. Cilia and flagella are
highly conserved slender cell appendages that exhibit spontaneous bending
waves. This flagellar beat represents a prime example of a chemo-mechanical
oscillator, which is driven by the collective dynamics of molecular motors
inside the flagellar axoneme. We study the nonlinear dynamics of flagellar
swimming, steering, and synchronization, which encompasses shape control of the
flagellar beat by chemical signals and mechanical forces. Mechanical forces can
synchronize collections of flagella to beat at a common frequency, despite
active motor noise that tends to randomize flagellar synchrony. In Chapter 2,
we present a new physical mechanism for flagellar synchronization by mechanical
self-stabilization that applies to free-swimming flagellated cells. This new
mechanism is independent of direct hydrodynamic interactions between flagella.
Comparison with experimental data provided by experimental collaboration
partners in the laboratory of J. Howard (Yale, New Haven) confirmed our new
mechanism in the model organism of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas.
Further, we characterize the beating flagellum as a noisy oscillator. Using a
minimal model of collective motor dynamics, we argue that measured
non-equilibrium fluctuations of the flagellar beat result from stochastic motor
dynamics at the molecular scale. Noise and mechanical coupling are antagonists

about the usage of data sets in addition to their preservation over time to
ensure reproducibility of results, to verify the work of others and to ensure
appropriate conditions data have been used for specific analyses. Scientific
workflow based studies are beginning to realize the benefit of capturing this
provenance of data and the activities used to process, transform and carry out
studies on those data. One way to support the development of workflows and
their use in (collaborative) biomedical analyses is through the use of a
Virtual Research Environment. The dynamic and distributed nature of Grid/Cloud
computing, however, makes the capture and processing of provenance information
a major research challenge. Furthermore most workflow provenance management
services are designed only for data-flow oriented workflows and researchers are
now realising that tracking data or workflows alone or separately is
insufficient to support the scientific process. What is required for
collaborative research is traceable and reproducible provenance support in a
full orchestrated Virtual Research Environment (VRE) that enables researchers
to define their studies in terms of the datasets and processes used, to monitor
and visualize the outcome of their analyses and to log their results so that
others users can call upon that acquired knowledge to support subsequent
studies. We have extended the work carried out in the neuGRID and N4U projects
in providing a so-called Virtual Laboratory to provide the foundation for a

Such refined meshes allow to reveal the existence of tori and structures

indicate the steady state probabilities. Additionally, second-order Markov
chains are considered for implementation, with bimolecular reactions rather

the methane production including novel chemical, geological, meteorological,

extremophile archaea which might be similar to some Earth based organisms which
can be studied exhaustively in a laboratory setting. Such organisms might
thrive in a subsurface ecosystem involving water and methane and as such could
leave a unique biosignature in the Martian regolith that could be preserved

extended depth range. We propose photonic force optical coherence elastography
(PF-OCE), leveraging phase-sensitive interferometric detection to track
sub-nanometre oscillations of beads, embedded in viscoelastic hydrogels,
induced by modulated radiation pressure. Since the displacements caused by
ultra-low radiation-pressure force are typically obscured by

often contrasted: the former as a standard tool of analysis, the latter as its
robust counterpart. I discuss the convolutions of these two popular
distributions and their applications in research. I consider four models within
a simple $2\times 2$ scheme which is of practical interest in the analysis of
clustered (e.g., longitudinal) data. In my view, these models, some of which
are less known than others by the majority of applied researchers, constitute a
'family' of sensible alternatives when modelling issues arise. In three
examples, I revisit data published recently in the epidemiological and clinical
literature as well as a classic biological dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07216v1,stat.ME

performance and functional range of novel computing substrates. Much has been
published in recent years regarding the use of biocomputers to solve minimal
path problems such as route optimisation and labyrinth navigation, but their
outputs are typically difficult to reproduce and somewhat abstract in nature,
suggesting that both experimental design and analysis in the field require
standardising. This chapter details laboratory experimental data which probe
the path finding process in two single-celled protistic model organisms,
Physarum polycephalum and Paramecium caudatum, comprising a shortest path
problem and labyrinth navigation, respectively. The results presented
illustrate several of the key difficulties that are encountered in categorising
biological behaviours in the language of computing, including biological
variability, non-halting operations and adverse reactions to experimental
stimuli. It is concluded that neither organism examined are able to efficiently
or reproducibly solve shortest path problems in the specific experimental
conditions that were tested. Data presented are contextualised with biological
theory and design principles for maximising the usefulness of experimental
biocomputer prototypes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03139v1,cs.ET

the biological sciences. From computational models of organelles, cells, and

ecosystems, a diverse array of biological systems have been the target of
large-scale computational modeling efforts. Nonetheless, these research agendas
have yet to prove decisively their value among the broader community of
theoretical and experimental biologists. In this commentary, we examine a range
of philosophical and practical issues relevant to understanding the potential
of integrative simulations. We discuss the role of theory and modeling in
different areas of physics and suggest that certain sub-disciplines of physics
provide useful cultural analogies for imagining the future role of simulations
in biological research. We examine philosophical issues related to modeling
which consistently arise in discussions about integrative simulations and
suggest a pragmatic viewpoint that balances a belief in philosophy with the
recognition of the relative infancy of our state of philosophical
understanding. Finally, we discuss community workflow and publication practices
to allow research to be readily discoverable and amenable to incorporation into
simulations. We argue that there are aligned incentives in widespread adoption
of practices which will both advance the needs of integrative simulation
efforts as well as other contemporary trends in the biological sciences,

performance on a metacognitive problem solving exercise appeared to have some
correlation with choice of major within life sciences, gains in conceptual
understanding and attitudes towards problem solving skills. We examine a larger
data set, taken from fourteen laboratory sections over six semesters of an
introductory algebra-based physics course at the University of Central
Arkansas, in which students worked on the problem solving exercise with their

diagnosis. In hospital, physicians rely on massive clinical data to make
diagnosis decisions, among which laboratory tests are one of the most important
resources. However, the longitudinal and incomplete nature of laboratory test
data casts a significant challenge on its interpretation and usage, which may
result in harmful decisions by both human physicians and automatic diagnosis
systems. In this work, we take advantage of deep generative models to deal with
the complex laboratory tests. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end
architecture that involves a deep generative variational recurrent neural
networks (VRNN) to learn robust and generalizable features, and a
discriminative neural network (NN) model to learn diagnosis decision making,
and the two models are trained jointly. Our experiments are conducted on a
dataset involving 46,252 patients, and the 50 most frequent tests are used to
predict the 50 most common diagnoses. The results show that our model, VRNN+NN,
significantly (p<0.001) outperforms other baseline models. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the representations learned by the joint training are more
informative than those learned by pure generative models. Finally, we find that
our model offers a surprisingly good imputation for missing values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.04329v2,cs.AI

electrophysiological parameters of neurons simultaneously with their synaptic
connectivity in a small model biological network. The DA procedure is cast as
an optimization, with a cost function consisting of both a measurement error
and a model error term. An iterative reweighting of these terms permits a
systematic method to identify the lowest minimum, within a local region of
state space, on the surface of a non-convex cost function. In the model, two
sets of parameter values are associated with two particular functional modes of
network activity: simultaneous firing of all neurons, and a pattern-generating
mode wherein the neurons burst in sequence. The DA procedure is able to recover
these modes if: i) the stimulating electrical currents have chaotic waveforms,
and ii) the measurements consist of the membrane voltages of all neurons in the
circuit. Further, this method is able to prune a model of unnecessarily high
dimensionality to a representation that contains the maximum dimensionality
required to reproduce the provided measurements. This paper offers a
proof-of-concept that DA has the potential to inform laboratory designs for
estimating properties in small and isolatable functional circuits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03834v8,q-bio.NC

structural properties of DNA molecules with different topology may thus help to
better understand genome functions. Whereas a number of structural studies have
been published on highly negatively supercoiled DNA molecules, only preliminary
observations of highly positively supercoiled are available, and a description

technique for representing and analyzing rule-based models of protein-protein
interaction networks. Rule-based modeling has proved instrumental in developing
biological models that are concise, comprehensible, easily extensible, and that
mitigate the combinatorial complexity of multi-state and multi-component
biological molecules. Our technique visualizes the dynamics of these rules as
they evolve over time. Using the data produced by KaSim, an open source
stochastic simulator of rule-based models written in the Kappa language, DINs
provide a node-link diagram that represents the influence that each rule has on
the other rules. That is, rather than representing individual biological
components or types, we instead represent the rules about them (as nodes) and
the current influence of these rules (as links). Using our interactive DIN-Viz

level of mechanical task performance. However, their underlying fundamental
biological vs. engineering mechanisms are, by definition, dramatically
different and can even be antithetical. Even our approach to each is
diametrically opposite: inductive science for the study of biological systems
vs. engineering synthesis for the design and construction of robotic systems.
The past 20 years have seen several conceptual advances in both fields and the
quest to unify them. Chief among them is the reluctant recognition that their
underlying fundamental mechanisms may actually share limited common ground,
while exhibiting many fundamental differences. This recognition is particularly
liberating because it allows us to resolve and move beyond multiple paradoxes
and contradictions that arose from the initial reasonable assumption of a large
common ground. Here, we begin by introducing the perspective of neuromechanics,
which emphasizes that real-world behavior emerges from the intimate
interactions among the physical structure of the system, the mechanical
requirements of a task, the feasible neural control actions to produce it, and
the ability of the neuromuscular system to adapt through interactions with the
environment. This allows us to articulate a succinct overview of a few salient
conceptual paradoxes and contradictions regarding under-determined vs.
over-determined mechanics, under- vs. over-actuated control, prescribed vs.
emergent function, learning vs. implementation vs. adaptation, prescriptive vs.
descriptive synergies, and optimal vs. habitual performance. We conclude by
presenting open questions and suggesting directions for future research. We

automated. Laboratory experiments are now performed automatically on
high-throughput machinery, while computational models are synthesized or
inferred automatically from data. However, integration between automated tasks
in the process of biological discovery is still lacking, largely due to
incompatible or missing formal representations. While theories are expressed
formally as computational models, existing languages for encoding and
automating experimental protocols often lack formal semantics. This makes it
challenging to extract novel understanding by identifying when theory and
experimental evidence disagree due to errors in the models or the protocols
used to validate them. To address this, we formalize the syntax of a core
protocol language, which provides a unified description for the models of
biochemical systems being experimented on, together with the discrete events
representing the liquid-handling steps of biological protocols. We present both
a deterministic and a stochastic semantics to this language, both defined in
terms of hybrid processes. In particular, the stochastic semantics captures
uncertainties in equipment tolerances, making it a suitable tool for both
experimental and computational biologists. We illustrate how the proposed
protocol language can be used for automated verification and synthesis of
laboratory experiments on case studies from the fields of chemistry and
molecular programming.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08016v2,cs.PL

remain large uncertainties in predicting and extrapolating biological responses
to humans. Exposure to cosmic radiation and Solar Particle Events may pose a
critical health risk to future spaceflight crews and can have a serious impact
to all biomedical aspects of space exploration. The relatively minimal
shielding of the cancelled 1960's Manned Orbiting Laboratory program's space
vehicle and the high inclination polar orbits would have left the crew
susceptible to high exposures of cosmic radiation and high dose-rate SPEs that
are mostly unpredictable in frequency and intensity. In this study, we have
modeled the nominal and off-nominal radiation environment that a MOL-like
spacecraft vehicle would be exposed to during a 30-day mission using high
performance, multi-core computers. Projected doses from a historically large
SPE (e.g. the August 1972 solar event) have been analyzed in the context of the
MOL orbit profile, providing an opportunity to study its impact to crew health
and subsequent contingencies.It is reasonable to presume that future
commercial, government, and military spaceflight missions in low-Earth orbit
will have vehicles with similar shielding and orbital profiles. Studying the
impact of cosmic radiation to the mission's operational integrity and the
health of MOL crewmembers provides an excellent surrogate and case-study for

reduce the external factors as much as possible. The acquired video is then
stabilized and a proposed algorithm used to reduce the illumination variations.
Lastly, the Euler magnification is utilized to magnify the color changes on the

throughout the animal kingdom, indicating that their design imparts a
significant evolutionary advantage. Insight into how this design is achieved is
hindered by the difficulty inherent in examining relationships among
electrophysiological properties of the constituent cells of a CPG and their
functional connectivity. That is: experimentally it is challenging to estimate
the values of more than two or three of these properties simultaneously. We
employ a method of statistical data assimilation (D.A.) to estimate the
synaptic weights, synaptic reversal potentials, and maximum conductances of ion
channels of the constituent neurons in a multi-modal network model. We then use
these estimates to predict the functional mode of activity that the network is
expressing. The measurements used are the membrane voltage time series of all
neurons in the circuit. We find that these measurements provide sufficient
information to yield accurate predictions of the network's associated
electrical activity. This experiment can apply directly in a real laboratory
using intracellular recordings from a known biological CPG whose structural
mapping is known, and which can be completely isolated from the animal. The
simulated results in this paper suggest that D.A. might provide a tool for

found in various objects associated with different star formation stages. The
identification of COMs in prestellar cores, i.e., cold environments in which
thermally induced chemistry can be excluded and radiolysis is limited by cosmic
rays and cosmic ray induced UV-photons, is particularly important as this stage
sets up the initial chemical composition from which ultimately stars and
planets evolve. Recent laboratory results demonstrate that molecules as complex
as glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol are efficiently formed on icy dust grains
via non-energetic atom addition reactions between accreting H atoms and CO
molecules, a process that dominates surface chemistry during the 'CO-freeze out
stage' in dense cores. In the present study we demonstrate that a similar
mechanism results in the formation of the biologically relevant molecule
glycerol - HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH - a three-carbon bearing sugar alcohol necessary
for the formation of membranes of modern living cells and organelles. Our
experimental results are fully consistent with a suggested reaction scheme in
which glycerol is formed along a chain of radical-radical and radical-molecule
interactions between various reactive intermediates produced upon hydrogenation
of CO ice or its hydrogenation products. The tentative identification of the

ability to generate similarly complex or non-random architectures in a large
abundance. From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells,
microbial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations
in biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies.
This is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves
construct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not
living, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological
organism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The
problem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an
approach that aims to evaluate complex objects as possible biosignatures.
However, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to
explore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove
rigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In
this paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity,
that allows us to not only threshold the abiotic-biotic divide, but to
demonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity
which can be used to unambiguously assign complex objects as biosignatures. We
hope that this approach not only opens up the search for biosignatures beyond
earth, but allow us to explore earth for new types of biology, as well as
observing when a complex chemical system discovered in the laboratory could be
considered alive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03460v1,q-bio.OT

structure and function of biomolecules. Computational prediction of protein
mutation impacts offers a fast, economical and potentially accurate alternative
to laboratory mutagenesis. Most existing methods rely on geometric
descriptions, this work introduces a topology based approach to provide an
entirely new representation of protein mutation impacts that could not be
obtained from conventional techniques. Results: Topology based mutation
predictor (T-MP) is introduced to dramatically reduce the geometric complexity
and number of degrees of freedom of proteins, while element specific persistent
homology is proposed to retain essential biological information. The present
approach is found to outperform other existing methods in globular protein
mutation impact predictions. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 with an
RMSE of 0.92 kcal/mol is obtained on a test set of 350 mutation samples. For
the prediction of membrane protein stability changes upon mutation, the
proposed topological approach has a 84% higher Pearson correlation coefficient

demonstrated the principle of SI-enabled three-dimensional (3D) QP
sub-diffraction imaging with calibration microspheres. Image analysis confirmed
enhanced lateral and axial resolutions over diffraction-limited QP imaging, and
established striking parallels between coherent SI and conventional optical

might help to revolutionise physics. For example, laboratory tests (such as
those anticipated in nanomechanical or biological systems) may look to rule out
macroscopic realism: the idea that the properties of macroscopic objects exist
objectively and can be non-invasively measured. Such investigations are likely
to suffer from i) stringent experimental requirements, ii) marginal statistical
significance and iii) logical loopholes. We address all of these problems by
refining two tests of macroscopic realism, or `quantum witnesses', and
implementing them in a microscopic test on a photonic qubit and qutrit. The
first witness heralds the invasiveness of a blind measurement; its maximum
violation has been shown to grow with the dimensionality of the system under
study. The second witness heralds the invasiveness of a generic quantum
operation, and can achieve its maximum violation in any dimension -- it
therefore allows for the highest quantum signal-to-noise ratio and most

nature and play an important role in industry and medicine. In contrast to
well-mixed, diluted cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in
a microcolony interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to
which they are attached. Despite their ubiquity, little is known about the role
of such mechanical interactions on growth and biological evolution of microbial
populations. Here we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped
cells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their
motion in the colony, this affects biological evolution. We show that the
probability that a faster-growing mutant ""surfs"" at the colony's frontier and
creates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape,
elasticity, friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing
probability in seemingly different ways, they all ultimately exhibit their
effects by altering the roughness of the expanding frontier of the colony and
the orientation of cells. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which
we measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness.
Our results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an
important role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these
interaction may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of
antibiotic resistance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03337v1,physics.bio-ph

Sparks', 'Rob J. M. van Spanning', 'Wilfred F. M. Röling', 'Frans Snik']","Circular polarization spectroscopy has proven to be an indispensable tool in
photosynthesis research and (bio)-molecular research in general. Oxygenic
photosystems typically display an asymmetric Cotton effect around the
chlorophyll absorbance maximum with a signal $\leq 1 \%$. In vegetation, these
signals are the direct result of the chirality of the supramolecular
aggregates. The circular polarization is thus directly influenced by the
composition and architecture of the photosynthetic macrodomains, and is thereby
linked to photosynthetic functioning. Although ordinarily measured only on a
molecular level, we have developed a new spectropolarimetric instrument,
TreePol, that allows for both laboratory and in-the-field measurements. Through
spectral multiplexing, TreePol is capable of fast measurements with a
sensitivity of $\sim 1*10^{-4}$ and is therefore suitable of non-destructively
probing the molecular architecture of whole plant leaves. We have measured the
chiroptical evolution of \textit{Hedera helix} leaves for a period of 22 days.
Spectrally resolved circular polarization measurements (450-900 nm) on whole
leaves in transmission exhibit a strong decrease in the polarization signal
over time after plucking, which we accredit to the deterioration of chiral
macro-aggregates. Chlorophyll \textit{a} levels measured over the same period
by means of UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a much
smaller decrease. With these results we are able to distinguish healthy from
deteriorating leaves. Hereby we indicate the potency of circular polarization
spectroscopy on whole and intact leaves as a nondestructive tool for structural

circular polarization signals as remotely accessible means of detecting the
presence of extraterrestrial life.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01297v1,q-bio.BM

constant environment. A species can maximize its overall abundance in the long
term by diversifying into coexisting subpopulations of both ""fast-growing"" and
""better-surviving"" individuals. Our model generalizes statistical physics
models of birth-death processes to incorporate dispersal, during which new
populations are founded, and can further incorporate variations of local
environments. In this way we unify different bet-hedging strategies against

attracted significant interest as a model of computation, an unifying principle

research in this topic is based on case-studies. There exists no generally
accepted criterion to distinguish between chemical processes that compute and
those that do not. Here, the concept of entropy driven computer (EDC) is
proposed as a general model of chemical computation. It is found that entropy
driven computation is subject to a trade-off between accuracy and entropy
production, but unlike many biological systems, there are no trade-offs
involving time. The latter only arise when it is taken into account that the
observation of the state of the EDC is not energy neutral, but comes at a cost.

Web technologies and the use of knowledge graphs for data integration,

Results: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge

representation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural
networks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information
within knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings
contain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to
the prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of
function prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein
interactions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that
matches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually
crafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph,

There are a number of possible learning goals for these courses including
reinforcing physics concepts, developing laboratory skills, and promoting
expert-like beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. However, there is
little consensus among instructors and researchers interested in the laboratory
learning environment as to relative importance of these various learning goals.
Here, we contribute data to this debate through the analysis of students'
responses to the laboratory-focused assessment known as the Colorado Learning
Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Using a
large, national data set of students' responses, we compare students' E-CLASS
performance in classes in which the instructor self-reported focusing on
developing skills, reinforcing concepts, or both. As the classification of
courses was based on instructor self-report, we also provide additional
description of these course with respect to how often students engage in
particular activities in the lab. We find that courses that focus specifically
on developing lab skills have more expert-like postinstruction E-CLASS
responses than courses that focus either on reinforcing physics concepts or on
both goals. Within first-year courses, this effect is larger for women.

designing addressable and functional self-organizing structures. These active
interactions also underpin collective behavior in biological systems. Here we
study a general setting of active particles in a bath of passive particles, and

particles. The mechanism operates when the translational persistence length of
the active particle motion is smaller than the particle diameter. In this
limit, the system reduces to particles of higher diffusivity (""hot"" particles)
in a bath of particles with lower diffusivity (""cold"" particles). This
attractive interaction arises as a hot particle pushes cold particles away to
create a large hole around itself, and the holes interact via a depletion-like
attraction. Strikingly, the interaction range is more than an order of
magnitude larger than the particle radius, well beyond the range of
conventional depletion force. Although the mechanism occurs outside the

workshops attached to them. The job of these workshops is to design and build
experimental setups and instruments for research and the training of
undergraduate students.
  However, in developing countries such as Sudan the lack of qualified
technicians and adequately equipped workshops hampered efforts by these
departments to supplement their laboratories with home built equipment. The
only other option is to buy needed equipment and experimental setups from
specialized manufactures. The latter option is not feasible the departments in
developing countries where funding for education and research is scarce and
very limited as equipments from these manufactures are typically too expensive.
  In the past couple of years and with the advancement in prototyping tools
like Arduino, and microcontroller development boards, more friendly programming
languages, 3D printers, desktop CNC machines and easy to use CAD/CAM softwares
the need for highly qualified technicians and expensive workshop equipment was
then relaxed \cite{nature-flypi}. The availability of such affordable, and
relatively easy to use tools had the effect of increasing the number of
teachers and researchers willing to develop their own experimental
setups\cite{polis-flypi}.
  During the past year and motivated by the need to equip our laboratories with
new setups we established a small workshop at the Department of Physics for
developing experimental setups to be used in our undergraduate laboratories.
The ultrasonic signal generator we are describing here is one such equipment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00492v2,physics.ed-ph

cooperation level based on her phoneotype i.e. a composite of an individual's
traits as observable via a mobile phone. This phone sensing-based method can
potentially complement surveys, thus providing a cheaper, faster, automated
method for generating insights into cooperation levels of users. Based on a
10-week field study involving 54 participants, we report that: (1) multiple
phone-based signals were significantly associated with participant's
cooperation attitudes; and (2) combining phone-based signals yielded a
predictive model with AUCROC of 0.945 that performed significantly better than
a comparable demography-based model at predicting individual cooperation

possibilities. The lack of rigorous scientific practices prevalent in
biologically inspired security research does not aid in presenting bio-inspired
security approaches as a viable way of dealing with complex security problems.
This chapter introduces a biologically inspired algorithm, called the Self
Organising Map (SOM), that was developed by Teuvo Kohonen in 1981. Since the
algorithm's inception it has been scrutinised by the scientific community and
analysed in more than 4000 research papers, many of which dealt with various

related SOM research undertaken in the past is presented and analysed. The
algorithm's biological analogies are detailed and the author's view on the
future possibilities of this successful bio-inspired approach are given. The

landscapes by assuming constant growth rates and random local movement.
Mounting evidence suggests, however, that demographic stochasticity,
environmental heterogeneity and non-random movement of individuals affect
considerably the spread dynamics. Here, we show that the dynamics of biological
invasions are controlled by the spatial heterogeneity of the resource
distribution. We show theoretically that increasing the landscape resource
autocorrelation length causes a reduction in the average speed of species
spread. Demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is
streghtened when individuals can actively move towards resources. The reduction
in the front propagation speed is verified in laboratory microcosm experiments
with the flagellated protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in habitats
characterized by different resource heterogeneity. Our theoretical and
experimental findings highlight the need to account for the intrinsic
stochasticity of population dynamics to describe spread in spatially extended
landscapes, which are inevitably characterized by heterogeneous spatial
distributions of resources controlling vital rates. Our work identifies the
resource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of
landscape susceptibility to biological invasions, with implications for
predicting the characters of biological invasions within naturally

properties of a system are defined as those which are preserved under an
arbitrary change of reference frame. For a system of quantum spins, these are
all properties preserved by proper spatial rotations of the laboratory.
However, this approach does not account for the hypothetical possibility of the
laboratory becoming entangled to the system, as described by a second
laboratory (the `Wigner's friend' scenario), in which case the relationship
between the two laboratories is not a rotation, but is fundamentally quantum.
To overcome this limitation, we re-define the reference frame transformations
to be those that preserve the fidelities between subsystems. This enables us to
derive U(2) as the correct symmetry group for transformations of a system of N
spin-half particles. Next, we propose that systems having the same internal
properties should be regarded as physically equivalent in the absence of an
external frame. Remarkably, this implies that a single spin in a superposition
relative to a spin magnet is equivalent to a macroscopic superposition of the
magnet relative to the spin. We discuss the implications of this result for the

relations between phonology and speech processing, and in broader terms, for
exploring relations between the abstract and physical structures of a speech
signal. Our goal is to make a step towards bridging phonology and speech
processing and to contribute to the program of Laboratory Phonology. We show
three application examples for laboratory phonology: compositional phonological
speech modelling, a comparison of phonological systems and an experimental
phonological parametric text-to-speech (TTS) system. The featural
representations of the following three phonological systems are considered in
this work: (i) Government Phonology (GP), (ii) the Sound Pattern of English
(SPE), and (iii) the extended SPE (eSPE). Comparing GP- and eSPE-based vocoded
speech, we conclude that the latter achieves slightly better results than the
former. However, GP - the most compact phonological speech representation -
performs comparably to the systems with a higher number of phonological
features. The parametric TTS based on phonological speech representation, and
trained from an unlabelled audiobook in an unsupervised manner, achieves
intelligibility of 85% of the state-of-the-art parametric speech synthesis. We
envision that the presented approach paves the way for researchers in both
fields to form meaningful hypotheses that are explicitly testable using the

phonologists might test the applied concepts of their theoretical models, and

testing-based method TROM (Transcriptome Overlap Measure) for comparing
transcriptomes within or between different species, and provide a different
perspective to interpret transcriptomic similarity in contrast to traditional
correlation analyses. Specifically, the TROM method focuses on identifying
associated genes that capture molecular characteristics of biological samples,
and subsequently comparing the biological samples by testing the overlap of
their associated genes. We use simulation and real data studies to demonstrate
that TROM is more powerful in identifying similar transcriptomes and more
robust to stochastic gene expression noise than Pearson and Spearman
correlations. We apply TROM to compare the developmental stages of six
Drosophila species, C. elegans, S. purpuratus, D. rerio and mouse liver, and

and hydroxyapatite. Associated complex interfaces and processes remain
difficult to analyze at the 1 to 100 nm scale using current laboratory
techniques, and prior models for atomistic simulations are limited in the
representation of chemical bonding, surface chemistry, and interfacial
interactions. This work introduces an accurate force field along with
pH-resolved surface models for hydroxyapatite to represent chemical bonding,
structural, surface, interfacial, and mechanical properties in quantitative
agreement with experiment. The accuracy is orders of magnitude higher in
comparison to earlier models to facilitate quantitative monitoring of
inorganic-biological assembly. The force field is integrated into the CHARMM,
AMBER, OPLS-AA, PCFF, and INTERFACE force fields to enable realistic
simulations of apatite-biological systems of any composition and ionic
strength. Specifically, the parameters reproduce lattice constants (<0.5%
deviation), IR spectrum, cleavage energies, immersion energies in water (<5%
deviation), and elastic constants (<10% deviation) of hydroxyapatite in
comparison to experiment. Interactions between mineral, water, and organic
compounds are represented by standard combination rules in the force field
without additional adjustable parameters and shown to achieve quantitative
accuracy. Surface models for common (001), (010), (020), (101) facets and
nanocrystals are introduced as a function of pH on the basis of extensive
experimental data. New insight into surface and immersion energies, the
structure of aqueous interfaces, density profiles, and superficial dissolution
is described. Mechanisms of specific binding of peptides, drugs, and
mineralization can be analyzed and the force field is extensible to substituted
and defective apatites as well as to other calcium phosphate phases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00122v1,cond-mat.mtrl-sci

approach is the analysis of these citation networks on learned literature by
presenting its typical steps and results. We have selected the bibliographic
insights into the ""The Biological Bulletin"", the journal published since 1897
by the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. Since the bibliographic
networks tend to be very scattered, their visualization requires of criteria of
convergence. To simplify, the main features in such a structure should include
the survey for authoritative sources in the hyperlinked environment and the
identification of thematic areas. By avoiding excessive loose connections and
too dense clustered layouts to be useful, a smooth presentation is obtained by
graphically depicting the citation patterns. HistComp computes 8884 articles
published by 'The Biological Bulletin' between 1945-2003. A two-dimensional
positioning of these papers that represent the extent of their bibliographic
coupling and co-citation is offered as a histograph. The criteria to construct
it is the adequateness of the visualization relative to the 8884 data set. The
spatial representation obtained optimizes the identification of the clusters or
topic areas. The thematic importance of marine science involves its
participation in 7 of the 7 presenting clusters. The mainstream subjects were
crustaceans and echinoderms, with some 60% of the material presented in the
graph. But sea anemone, with about 16% of the total, remains as the best

interactions between individual members of the group. In many cases, such as
birds, fish, or ungulates, these interactions are mediated by sensory stimuli
that predominantly arise from nearby neighbors. But not all stimuli in animal

interact primarily via long-range acoustic stimuli. We exploit the similarity
in form between the decay of acoustic and gravitational sources to build a
model for swarm behavior. By accounting for the adaptive nature of the midges'
acoustic sensing, we show that our ""adaptive gravity"" model makes mean-field
predictions that agree well with experimental observations of laboratory

energy from photons of solar origin for biological use. Subsurface regions are
isolated from the photosphere, and consequently are incapable of utilizing this
energy. This opens up the opportunity for life to evolve alternate mechanisms
for harvesting available energy. Bacterium Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator,
found 2.8 km deep in a South African mine, harvests energy from radiolysis,
induced by particles emitted from radioactive U, Th and K present in
surrounding rock. Another radiation source in the subsurface environments is
secondary particles generated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Using Monte Carlo
simulations, it is shown that it is a steady source of energy comparable to
that produced by radioactive substances, and the possibility of a slow
metabolizing life flourishing on it cannot be ruled out. Two mechanisms are
proposed through which GCR-induced secondary particles can be utilized for
biological use in subsurface environments: (1) GCRs injecting energy in the
environment through particle-induced radiolysis, and (2) organic synthesis from
GCR secondaries interacting with the medium. Laboratory experiments to test

Nanodevices, or, more precisely, memory or memristive devices, have been

filament growth (i.e., increased conductance) in filamentary memory devices. In

of variable density and width, can permit the short- and long-term processes to

mutations - is essential for understanding the relationship of genotype,
phenotype, and fitness in biological systems. The applications cover many areas
of biological research, including biochemistry, genomics, protein and systems
engineering, medicine, and evolutionary biology. However, the quantitative
definitions of epistasis vary among fields, and its analysis beyond just
pairwise effects remains obscure in general. Here, we show that different
definitions of epistasis are versions of a single mathematical formalism - the
weighted Walsh-Hadamard transform. We discuss that one of the definitions, the
backgound-averaged epistasis, is the most informative when the goal is to
uncover the general epistatic structure of a biological system, a description
that can be rather different from the local epistatic structure of specific
model systems. Key issues are the choice of effective ensembles for averaging
and to practically contend with the vast combinatorial complexity of mutations.
In this regard, we discuss possible approaches for optimally learning the
epistatic structure of biological systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.00726v2,q-bio.QM

response (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). Yet, due to unavoidable inter-individual
variations, the exact trajectories characterising the biological responses
differ. We examined whether the differences seen between metabolic trajectories

biological manifestations of the same treatment. Differences in trajectories
were measured via alignment procedures which introduced and implemented in this
study. Our study revealed strong correlation between the scales of the aligned
trajectories of metabolic responses and the severity of the hepatocelluar
lesions induced after administration of hydrazine. Thus the results confirm
that aligned trajectories are characteristic of a specific treatment. They then
can be used for comparison with other treatment specific or unknown metabolic
trajectories and can have many metabonomic applications such as preclinical

elimination of superoxide was superoxide dismutase, SOD. SOD has been found in
almost all organisms living in the presence of oxygen, including some anaerobic

of oxidative stress. Recently, a new concept in the field of the mechanisms of
cellular defense against superoxide has emerged. It was discovered that
elimination of superoxide in some anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria could
occur by reduction, a reaction catalyzed by a small metalloenzyme thus named
superoxide reductase, SOR. Having played a major role in this discovery, we
describe here how the concept of superoxide reduction emerged and how it was

filtration rate (eGFR). However, eGFR values are recorded without reference to
the creatinine (SCr) assays used to derive them, and newer assays were
introduced at different time points across laboratories in UK. These changes
may cause systematic bias in eGFR reported in routinely collected data; even
though laboratory reported eGFR values have a correction factor applied.
  Design: An algorithm to detect changes in SCr which affect eGFR calculation
method by comparing the mapping of SCr values on to eGFR values across a
time-series of paired eGFR and SCr measurements.
  Setting: Routinely collected primary care data from 20,000 people with the
richest renal function data from the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney
Disease (QICKD) trial.
  Results: The algorithm identified a change in eGFR calculation method in 80
(63%) of the 127 included practices. This change was identified in 4,736
(23.7%) patient time series analysed. This change in calibration method was
found to cause a significant step change in reported eGFR values producing a
systematic bias. eGFR values could not be recalibrated by applying the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to the laboratory
reported SCr values.
  Conclusions: This algorithm can identify laboratory changes in eGFR
calculation methods and changes in SCr assay. Failure to account for these
changes may misconstrue renal function changes over time. Researchers using
routine eGFR data should account for these effects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1542v1,q-bio.QM

range of applications arise from the ability to not just understand, but to
engineer, coherence and correlations at the quantum level. In the past few
years, quite dramatic progress has been seen in applying these ideas into
biological systems. Capabilities that have been demonstrated include enhanced
sensitivity and resolution, immunity to imaging artifacts and technical noise,
and characterization of the biological response to light at the single-photon
level. New quantum measurement techniques offer even greater promise, raising
the prospect for improved multi-photon microscopy and magnetic imaging, among

our experience. Objects move in predictable ways and their features and
identity remain stable across time and space. How does the brain leverage this
structure to make predictions about and learn from the environment? This thesis
describes research centered around a mechanistic description of sensory
prediction called LeabraTI (TI: Temporal Integration) that explains precisely
how predictive processing is accomplished in neocortical microcircuits. The
fundamental prediction of LeabraTI is that predictions and sensations are
interleaved across the same neural tissue at an overall rate of 10 Hz,
corresponding to the widely studied alpha rhythm of posterior cortex.
Experiments described herein tested this prediction by manipulating the
spatiotemporal properties of three-dimensional object stimuli in a laboratory
setting. EEG results indicated that predictions were subserved by ~10 Hz
oscillations that reliably tracked the onset of stimuli and differentiated
between spatially predictable and unpredictable object sequences. There was a
behavioral advantage for combined spatial and temporal predictability for
discrimination of unlearned objects, but prolonged study of objects under this
combined predictability context impaired discriminability relative to other
learning contexts. This counterintuitive pattern of results was accounted for
by a neural network model that learned three-dimensional viewpoint invariance
with LeabraTI's spatiotemporal prediction rule. Synaptic weight scaling from
prolonged learning built viewpoint invariance, but led to confusion between
ambiguous views of objects, producing slightly lower performance on average.
Overall, this work advances a biological architecture for sensory prediction

space-varying inputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5328v1,q-bio.NC

characterize a large set of networks of fungi and slime moulds grown under a

estimating cord conductances (which yield edge weights) from the experimental

on how much nutrient traffic is predicted to occur along each edge. Both types
of networks have the same topology, and we compute MRFs for both families of

the networks into clusters of related fungi and slime moulds. Although both
network taxonomies generate intuitively sensible groupings of networks across
species, treatments and laboratories, we find that clustering using the
functional-network measure appears to give groups with lower intra-group
variation in species or treatments. We argue that MRFs provide a useful
quantitative analysis of network behaviour that can (1) help summarize an
expanding set of increasingly complex biological networks and (2) help extract

homochirality. The result is optical activity of biological materials and
circular polarization in the light scattered by microorganisms, cells of living
organisms, as well as molecules (e.g. amino acids) of biological origin. Lab
measurements (Sparks et al. 2009a, b) have found that light scattered by
certain biological systems, in particular photosynthetic organisms, is not only
circular polarized but contains a characteristic spectral trend, showing a fast
change and reversal of sign for circular polarization within absorption bands.
Similar behavior can be expected for other biological and prebiological
organics, especially amino acids. We begin our study by reproducing the
laboratory measurements for photosynthetic organisms through modeling the
biological material as aggregated structures and using the Multiple Sphere
T-matrix (MSTM) code for light scattering calculations. We further study how
the spectral effect described above depends on the porosity of the aggregates
and the size and number of the constituent particles (monomers). We show that
larger aggregates are characterized by larger values of circular polarization
and discuss how light-scattering characteristics of individual monomers and
electromagnetic interaction between them affect this result. We find that
circular polarization typically peaks at medium (40-140{\deg}) scattering
angles, and discuss recommendations for efficient remote observation of

social media and search queries are emerging. These efforts are promising, but
important challenges in the areas of scientific peer review, breadth of
diseases and countries, and forecasting hamper their operational usefulness.
  We examine a freely available, open data source for this use: access logs
from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Using linear models, language as a
proxy for location, and a systematic yet simple article selection procedure, we
tested 14 location-disease combinations and demonstrate that these data
feasibly support an approach that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, our
proof-of-concept yields models with $r^2$ up to 0.92, forecasting value up to
the 28 days tested, and several pairs of models similar enough to suggest that
transferring models from one location to another without re-training is
feasible.
  Based on these preliminary results, we close with a research agenda designed
to overcome these challenges and produce a disease monitoring and forecasting
system that is significantly more effective, robust, and globally comprehensive
than the current state of the art.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3612v2,cs.SI

radioactive particles is highly inhomogeneous in the central airways. The
objective of this research is to investigate the consequences of this
heterogeneity regarding cellular burdens in the bronchial epithelium and to
study the possible biological effects on tissue level. Applying a computational
fluid dynamics program, the deposition distribution of inhaled radon daughters
has been determined in a bronchial airway model for 23 minutes of work in the
New Mexico uranium mine corresponding to 0.0129 WLM exposure. A numerical
epithelium model based on experimental data has been utilized in order to
quantify cellular hits and doses. Finally, a carcinogenesis model considering
cell death induced cell cycle shortening has been applied to assess the
biological responses. Computations present, that cellular dose may reach 1.5
Gy, which is several orders of magnitude higher than tissue dose. The results
are in agreement with the histological finding that the uneven deposition
distribution of radon progenies may lead to inhomogeneous spatial distribution

progressively expanding databases of experimental datasets in order to keep
research cumulative. We introduce the idea of a modeling-based dataset
retrieval engine designed for relating a researcher's experimental dataset to
earlier work in the field. The search is (i) data-driven to enable new
findings, going beyond the state of the art of keyword searches in annotations,
(ii) modeling-driven, to both include biological knowledge and insights learned
from data, and (iii) scalable, as it is accomplished without building one
unified grand model of all data. Assuming each dataset has been modeled
beforehand, by the researchers or by database managers, we apply a rapidly
computable and optimizable combination model to decompose a new dataset into
contributions from earlier relevant models. By using the data-driven
decomposition we identify a network of interrelated datasets from a large
annotated human gene expression atlas. While tissue type and disease were major
driving forces for determining relevant datasets, the found relationships were
richer and the model-based search was more accurate than keyword search; it
moreover recovered biologically meaningful relationships that are not
straightforwardly visible from annotations, for instance, between cells in
different developmental stages such as thymocytes and T-cells. Data-driven
links and citations matched to a large extent; the data-driven links even
uncovered corrections to the publication data, as two of the most linked

processes. Diseases occur when normal functionality of these processes is
disrupted. Thus, understanding these biochemical processes and their
interrelationships is a primary task in biomedical research and a prerequisite
for diagnosing diseases, and drug development. Scientists studying these
processes have identified various pathways responsible for drug metabolism, and
signal transduction, etc.
  Newer techniques and speed improvements have resulted in deeper knowledge
about these pathways, resulting in refined models that tend to be large and
complex, making it difficult for a person to remember all aspects of it. Thus,
computer models are needed to analyze them. We want to build such a system that
allows modeling of biological systems and pathways in such a way that we can
answer questions about them.
  Many existing models focus on structural and/or factoid questions, using
surface-level knowledge that does not require understanding the underlying
model. We believe these are not the kind of questions that a biologist may ask
someone to test their understanding of the biological processes. We want our
system to answer the kind of questions a biologist may ask. Such questions
appear in early college level text books.
  Thus the main goal of our thesis is to develop a system that allows us to
encode knowledge about biological pathways and answer such questions about them
demonstrating understanding of the pathway. To that end, we develop a language
that will allow posing such questions and illustrate the utility of our
framework with various applications in the biological domain. We use some
existing tools with modifications to accomplish our goal.
  Finally, we apply our system to real world applications by extracting pathway

developed to assess problem solving, laboratory, calculational and conceptual

high biosafety (BSL-4) laboratories entered into operation, raising strong
concerns from the public. The probability of an accidental release of a
pathogen from a BSL-4 laboratory is extremely low, but the corresponding risk
-- defined as the probability of occurrence multiplied by its impact -- could
be significant depending on the pathogen specificities and the population
potentially affected. A list of BSL-4 laboratories throughout the world, with
their location and date of first activity, was established from publicly
available sources. This database was used to estimate the total population
living within a daily commuting distance of BSL-4 laboratories, and to quantify
how this figure changed over time. We show that from 1990 to present, the

major challenges of theoretical physics. This problem can be cracked in part by
investigating the macroscopic fluctuations of the currents characterizing
nonequilibrium behavior, their statistics and associated structures. This
fundamental line of research has been severely hampered by the overwhelming
complexity of this problem. However, during the last years two new general
methods have appeared to investigate fluctuating behavior that are changing
radically our understanding of nonequilibrium physics: a powerful macroscopic
fluctuation theory (MFT) and a set of advanced computational techniques to
measure rare events. In this work we study the statistics of current
fluctuations in nonequilibrium diffusive systems, using macroscopic fluctuation
theory as theoretical framework, and advanced Monte Carlo simulations of
several stochastic lattice gases as a laboratory to test the emerging picture.
Our quest will bring us from (1) the confirmation of an additivity conjecture
in one and two dimensions, which considerably simplifies the MFT complex
variational problem to compute the thermodynamics of currents, to (2) the
discovery of novel isometric fluctuation relations, which opens an unexplored
route toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing
symmetry principles to the realm of fluctuations, and to (3) the observation of
coherent structures in fluctuations, which appear via dynamic phase transitions
involving a spontaneous symmetry breaking event at the fluctuating level. The
clear-cut observation, measurement and characterization of these unexpected
phenomena, well described by MFT, strongly support this theoretical scheme as

optical detection to single molecules using fluorescence. This breakthrough has
revolutionized biophysical measurements, but restrictions in photophysics and
labeling protocols have motivated many efforts to achieve fluorescence-free
single-molecule sensitivity in biological studies. Although several interesting
mechanisms using vibrational spectroscopy, photothermal detection, plasmonics
or microcavities have been proposed for biosensing at the single-protein level,
no method has succeeded in direct label-free detection of single proteins.
Here, we present the first results using interferometric detection of
scattering (iSCAT) from single proteins without the need for any label, optical
nanostructure or microcavity. Furthermore, we demonstrate super-resolution

focus of recent decades has been the development of algorithms to effectively
navigate this space. However this space is tiny when compared with the space of

poorly understood problem. This, and the difficulty of biologically
interpreting such networks, obstructs adoption of networks as tools for

scale are generally equipment-intensive and time-consuming. The use of
energetic beams of electrons or ions has placed the fabrication of nanopores in
thin solid-state membranes within reach of some academic laboratories, yet
these tools are not accessible to many researchers and are poorly suited for
mass-production. Here we describe a fast and simple approach for fabricating a
single nanopore down to 2-nm in size with sub-nm precision, directly in
solution, by controlling dielectric breakdown at the nanoscale. The method
relies on applying a voltage across an insulating membrane to generate a high
electric field, while monitoring the induced leakage current. We show that
nanopores fabricated by this method produce clear electrical signals from
translocating DNA molecules. Considering the tremendous reduction in complexity
and cost, we envision this fabrication strategy would not only benefit
researchers from the physical and life sciences interested in gaining reliable
access to solid-state nanopores, but may provide a path towards manufacturing

functions, which can be exploited for a large variety of applications. This
paves the way to several advanced uses of synthetic cells in basic science and

of biological species, a second evolutionary process has appeared on our
planet. It is the evolution of culture-e.g., ideas, beliefs, and artifacts.
Does culture evolve in the same genuine sense as biological life? And if so,
does it evolve through natural selection, or by some other means? Why does no
other species remotely approach the degree of cultural complexity of humans?
These questions lie at the foundation of who we are and what makes our lives
meaningful. Although much research has been done on how selective pressures
operating at the biological level affect cognition and culture, little research
has focused on culture as an evolutionary process in its own right. Like
biological forms, cultural forms-ideas, attitudes, artifacts, mannerisms,
etc.-incrementally adapt to the constraints and affordances of their
environment through descent with modification. In some respects culture appears
to be Darwinian, i.e., a process of differential replication and selection
amongst randomly generated variants. This suggests that knowledge of biological
evolution can be put to use to gain insight into culture. However, attempts to
apply Darwinian theory to culture have not yielded the kind of unifying
framework for the social sciences that it provided for the biological sciences,
largely because of the nonrandom manner in which the mind-the hub of cultural
change-generates and assimilates novelty. This paper investigates how and when
humans became capable of supporting culture, and what previously held it back,
focusing on how we attained the creative powers we now possess. To invent in
the strategic, intuitive manner characteristic of humans requires a cognitive
architecture that supports the capacity to spontaneously adapt concepts to new
circumstances and merge them together to conceptualize new situations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4712v3,q-bio.PE

geomagnetic field is still a mystery in many species. The radical pair
mechanism, in which very weak magnetic fields can influence certain types of
spin-dependent chemical reactions, leading to biologically observable signals,
has recently imposed itself as one of the most promising candidates for certain
species. This is thanks both to its extreme sensitivity and its capacity to
reproduce results from behavioral studies. Still, in order to gain a
directional sensitivity, an anisotropic mechanism is needed. Recent proposals
have explored the possibility that such an anisotropy is due to the
electron-nucleus hyperfine interaction. In this work we explore a different
possibility, in which the anisotropy is due to spin-orbit coupling between the
electron spin and its angular momentum. We will show how a
spin-orbit-coupling-based magnetic compass can have performances comparable
with the usually-studied nuclear-hyperfine based mechanism. Our results could
thus help researchers actively looking for candidate biological molecules which

across several scientific disciplines including ecology and conservation
biology. Unfortunately, most methods proposed to reduce the fluctuations in
chaotic systems are not applicable for real, biological populations. This is
because such methods typically require detailed knowledge of system specific
parameters and the ability to manipulate them in real time; conditions often
not met by most real populations. Moreover, real populations are often noisy
and extinction-prone, which can sometimes render such methods ineffective. Here
we investigate a control strategy, which works by perturbing the population
size, and is robust to reasonable amounts of noise and extinction probability.
This strategy, called the Adaptive Limiter Control (ALC), has been previously
shown to increase constancy and persistence of laboratory populations and
metapopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present a detailed
numerical investigation of the effects of ALC on the fluctuations and
persistence of metapopulations. We show that at high migration rates,
application of ALC does not require a priori information about the population
growth rates. We also show that ALC can stabilize metapopulations even when
applied to as low as one-tenth of the total number of subpopulations. Moreover,
ALC is effective even when the subpopulations have high extinction rates:
conditions under which one other control algorithm has previously failed to
attain stability. Importantly, ALC not only reduces the fluctuation in
metapopulation sizes, but also the global extinction probability. Finally, the
method is robust to moderate levels of noise in the dynamics and the carrying
capacity of the environment. These results, coupled with our earlier empirical
findings, establish ALC to be a strong candidate for stabilizing real
biological metapopulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1917v1,q-bio.PE

switching between the two stable states controlled by certain conditions. Since
understanding bistability is key for understanding these biological systems,
mathematical modeling of the bistability phenomenon has been at the focus of
researches in quantitative and system biology. Recent study shows that Boolean
networks offer relative simple mathematical models that are capable of
capturing these essential information. Thus a better understanding of the
Boolean networks with bistability property is desirable for both theoretical
and application purposes. In this paper, we describe an algebraic condition for
the number of stable states (fixed points) of a Boolean network based on its
polynomial representation, and derive algorithms for a Boolean network to have
a single stable state or two stable states. As an example, we also construct a

peculiarities connected, first, with accounting for internal friction and
dissipation of energy, and secondly, with nonlinearity of their elastic and
viscous properties, that is with violation of Hook and Newtons laws.
Traditional approaches to mechanics of viscoelastic bodies sometimes are
excessively difficult, and more evident and available representations are
necessary. The invaluable role in studying of the operating processes
mechanisms of elastic deformation and motility of biological materials is
played by the mathematical modeling. New effect obtained by means of computer
experiment of nonmonotonic relaxation of deformation in heterogeneous media is
considered in the present work. Rheological properties of described media are
governed by the differential equations of the first order on time (the
evolution equations), as well as a huge variety of other physical processes.
The physical phenomena in nonlinear systems with dissipation have a big
community, including such it would seem far areas, as dynamics of magnetization

environment. Principles of biological terrestrial locomotion have been
discovered on unconfined vertical and horizontal substrates. However a
diversity of organisms construct, inhabit, and move within confined spaces.
Such animals are faced with locomotor challenges including limited limb range
of motion, crowding, and visual sensory deprivation. Little is known about how
these organisms accomplish their locomotor tasks, and such environments
challenge human-made devices. To gain greater insight into how animals move
within confined spaces we study the confined locomotion of the fire ant {\em
Solenopsis invicta}, which constructs subterranean tunnel networks (nests).
Laboratory experiments reveal that ants construct tunnels with diameter, D,
comparable to bodylength, L=3.5 $\pm$ 0.5 mm. Ants can move rapidly (> 9
bodylengths/sec) within these environments; their tunnels allow for effective
limb, body, and antennae interaction with walls which facilitate rapid
slip-recovery during ascending and descending climbs. To examine the limits of
slip-recovery in artificial tunnels we perform perturbations consisting of
rapid downward accelerations of the tunnels, which induce falls. Below a
critical tunnel diameter, $D_s = 1.31 \pm 0.02$ L, falls are always arrested
through rapid interaction of appendages and antennae with tunnel walls to jam
the falls. $D_s$ is comparable to the size of incipient nest tunnels (D = 1.06

which simplify their control task when moving through the nest, likely without

Asian and African/S. E. Asian populations defining the major axes of genetic
variation. At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives and
sake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One
population, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high
levels of heterozygosity and mixtures of alleles from European and Asian
populations, indicating an admixed origin for this group. In the context of
this global diversity, we demonstrate that a collection of seven strains
commonly used in the laboratory encompasses only one quarter of the genetic
diversity present in the full collection of strains, underscoring the
relatively limited genetic diversity captured by the current set of lab
strains. We propose a model of geographic differentiation followed by
human-associated admixture, primarily between European and Asian populations
and more recently between European and North American populations. The large
collection of genotyped yeast strains characterized here will provide a useful
resource for the broad community of yeast researchers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.4835v1,q-bio.PE

deprivation of the geomagnetic field affected human cognitive processes as
estimated in several computer tests. The exposure to the hypomagnetic field

the present work, the results of a simultaneous study are described, in which
the right eye of each subject was video recorded, while the subject performed

This effect has been calculated based on the treatment of a large data set of
about 6.10^6 video frames. Averaged all over the frames, the magnetic effect on
the pupil area was about 1.6%, with high statistical confidence. This is the
first laboratory study in which the number of separate trials has been large

increasing the soft tissue contrast in medical imaging. In this work, the
signature of lung tissue in X-ray grating-based physe-contrast imaging is
investigated. Methods: We used a Talbot-Lau interferometer for our

computed tomography. Results: The results show that the three images obtained
by X-ray phase-contrast imaging show complementary anatomical structures.
Especially the dark field image allows a more-exact determination of the
position of the lung in the chest cavity. Conclusion: Due to its sensitivity to
granular structures, the dark field image may be used for the diagnosis of lung
diseases in earlier stages or without a CT scan. Furthermore, X-ray

purposes align closely: explaining patterns and processes in the natural world

discuss how research-supported approaches developed by physics education
researchers can be adopted by biologists to enhance student problem-solving
skills. First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically
asked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the
development of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills
in problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems
requires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use
in representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and
verifying or checking solutions. We assert that acquiring these skills can help
biology students become competent problem solvers. Finally, we propose how
biology scholars can apply lessons from physics education in their classrooms

systems using reduced descriptions much as an engineer uses a 'black box'
description of an amplifier. Simple models have been used by physiologists for
a very long time. Physiologists have successfully analyzed a broad range of
biological systems using a 'device-oriented' approach similar to the approach
an engineer would use to investigate her devices. The present generation views
biology through the powerful lenses of structural and (molecular) dynamic
analysis, understandably enough because of the beauty and power of the
analysis, and the ease of using these structures with present freely available
software. The problem is that these powerful lenses offer such magnification
that the engineering approach cannot be seen. High magnification means limited
field of view, because the (spatial) dynamic range cannot cover everything. The
function of the structures and molecular dynamics cannot be seen in the work of
many biologists, probably because function cannot be immediately seen in the
structures and molecular dynamics they compute. It is just as important for
biologists to measure the inputs and outputs of their systems as it is to
measure their structures. It seems clear, at least to one physiologist, that
this research will be catalyzed by assuming that most biological systems are
devices that can be analyzed with the same strategies one would use to analyze
engineering devices. Thinking today about your biological preparation as a

oscillations in the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of the transcription

states where the ratios of the internal to external frequency are close to
rational numbers. We predict a specific response diagram of the TNF-driven
NF-kB system which exhibits bands of synchronization known as ""Arnold tongues"".
Our model also suggests that when the amplitude of the external stimulus

growth conditions very different from those of a typical laboratory xperiment.
In particular, removal rates of biomass and substrate are unlikely to be
balanced under realistic environmental conditions. Here, we consider a single
population growing on a substrate under conditions where the removal rates of
substrate and biomass are not necessarily equal. For a large population, with
deterministic growth dynamics, our model predicts that this system can show
transient (damped) oscillations. For a small population, demographic noise
causes these oscillations to be sustained indefinitely. These oscillations
arise when the dynamics of changes in biomass are faster than the dynamics of
the substrate, for example, due to a high microbial death rate and/or low
substrate flow rates. We show that the same mechanism can produce sustained
stochastic oscillations in a two-species, nutrient-cycling microbial ecosystem.

Laboratory notebooks are used to record each step in conducting an experiment
and processing data. Originally, these notebooks were paper based. Due to
computerised research systems, acquired data became more elaborate, thus
increasing the need for electronic notebooks with data storage, computational
features and reliable electronic documentation. As a new approach to this, a
scientific data management system (DataFinder) is enhanced with features for
traceable documentation. Provenance recording is used to meet requirements of
traceability, and this information can later be queried for further analysis.
DataFinder has further important features for scientific documentation: It
employs a heterogeneous and distributed data storage concept. This enables
access to different types of data storage systems (e. g. Grid data
infrastructure, file servers). In this chapter we describe a number of building
blocks that are available or close to finished development. These components
are intended for assembling an electronic laboratory notebook for use in Grid
environments, while retaining maximal flexibility on usage scenarios as well as
maximal compatibility overlap towards each other. Through the usage of such a
system, provenance can successfully be used to trace the scientific workflow of
preparation, execution, evaluation, interpretation and archiving of research
data. The reliability of research results increases and the research process
remains transparent to remote research partners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.3062v1,cs.DC

allowed researchers to identify various biochemical interactions and define
different families of pathways. There is an increased interest in identifying
pathways and pathway elements involved in particular biological processes. Drug
discovery efforts, for example, are focused on identifying biomarkers as well
as pathways related to a disease. We propose a Bayesian model that addresses
this question by incorporating information on pathways and gene networks in the
analysis of DNA microarray data. Such information is used to define pathway
summaries, specify prior distributions, and structure the MCMC moves to fit the
model. We illustrate the method with an application to gene expression data
with censored survival outcomes. In addition to identifying markers that would
have been missed otherwise and improving prediction accuracy, the integration
of existing biological knowledge into the analysis provides a better
understanding of underlying molecular processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.5419v1,stat.AP

strongest active machines in the biomolecular world, being able to package
several tens of kilobase pairs of viral genome into a capsid within minutes.
Yet these motors are hindered at the end of the packaging process by the
progressive build-up of a force resisting packaging associated with already
packaged DNA. In this experimental work, we raise the issue of what sets the
upper limit on the length of the genome that can be packaged by the terminase
motor of phage {\lambda} and still yield infectious virions, and the conditions
under which this can be efficiently performed. Using a packaging strategy
developed in our laboratory of building phage {\lambda} from scratch, together
with plaque assay monitoring, we have been able to show that the terminase
motor of phage {\lambda} is able to produce infectious particles with up to
110% of the wild-type (WT) {\lambda}-DNA length. However, the phage production
rate, and thus the infectivity, decreased exponentially with increasing DNA
length, and was a factor of 103 lower for the 110% {\lambda}-DNA phage.
Interestingly, our in vitro strategy was still efficient in fully packaging
phages with DNA lengths as high as 114% of the WT length, but these viruses
were unable to infect bacterial cells efficiently. Further, we demonstrated
that the phage production rate is modulated by the presence of multivalent
ionic species. The biological consequences of these finding are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.2143v1,physics.bio-ph

(CES) as yet, this paper claims that bio-inspired engineering can help provide
such a frame. Within CES bio-inspired systems play a key role. The disclosure
from bio-inspired systems and biological computation has not been sufficiently
worked out, however. Biological computation is to be taken as the processing of
information by living systems that is carried out in polynomial time, i.e.,
efficiently; such processing however is grasped by current science and research
as an intractable problem (for instance, the protein folding problem). A remark
is needed here: P versus NP problems should be well defined and delimited but
biological computation problems are not. The shift from conventional
engineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of
computability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the
prevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words,
conventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt).
However, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here
that biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us
towards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must
turn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can
and should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems.
Biological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then
the focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but
computation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier. We claim that we need a new
computational theory that encompasses biological processes wherein the
Turing-Church thesis is but a particular case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.3316v1,cs.OH

attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of

biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming
procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and
interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory
implementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing
machine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA
computers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory
implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing
DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton
established by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new
attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing
two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works.

oxy-acetylene driven laboratory scale shock tubes. Such tools are needed to
produce realistic blast waves in a laboratory setting. The pressure-time
profiles measured at 1 MHz using high speed piezoelectric pressure sensors have
relevant durations and show a true shock front and exponential decay
characteristic of free-field blast waves. Descriptions are included for shock
tube diameters of 27 - 79 mm. A range of peak pressures from 204 kPa to 1187
kPa (with 0.5 - 5.6% standard error of the mean) were produced by selection of
the driver section diameter and distance from the shock tube opening. The peak
pressures varied predictably with distance from the shock tube opening while
maintaining both a true blast wave profile and relevant pulse duration for
distances up to about one diameter from the shock tube opening. This shock tube
design provides a more realistic blast profile than current compression-driven
shock tubes, and it does not have a large jet effect. In addition, operation
does not require specialized personnel or facilities like most blast-driven
shock tubes, which reduces operating costs and effort and permits greater
throughput and accessibility. It is expected to be useful in assessing the
response of various sensors to shock wave loading; assessing the reflection,
transmission, and absorption properties of candidate armor materials; assessing
material properties at high rates of loading; assessing the response of
biological materials to shock wave exposure; and providing a means to validate
numerical models of the interaction of shock waves with structures. All of

deterioration of physiological function with age and an increase of
vulnerability to disease and death. Living systems, known as complex systems,
require complexity in interactions among molecules, cells, organs, and
individuals or regulatory mechanisms to perform a variety of activities for
survival. On this basis, aging can be understood in terms of a progressive loss
of complexity with age; this suggests that complexity in living systems would
evolve with age. In general, aging dynamics is mathematically depicted by a
survival function, which monotonically changes from 1 to 0 with age. It would
be then useful to find an adequate survival function to link aging dynamics and
complexity evolution. Here we describe a flexible survival function, which is
derived from the stretched exponential function by adopting an age-dependent
exponent. We note that the exponent is associated with evolving complexity,
i.e., a fractal-like scaling in cumulative mortality. The survival function
well depicts a general feature in survival curves; healthy populations show a
tendency to evolve towards rectangular-like survival curves, as examples in
humans or laboratory animals. This tendency suggests that both aging and
complexity would evolve towards healthy survival in living systems. Our
function to link aging with complexity may contribute to better understanding

that if the prevalence of positive samples is greater than 30% it is never

1% substantial gains can be made by pooling, especially if the samples are

Computing and Biologically Inspired Process Calculi, held in Bologna on 5th
September 2009. The papers are devoted to both membrane computing and
biologically inspired process calculi, as well as to other related formalisms.
The papers of this volume are selected by the programme committee due to their
quality and relevance; they have defined an exciting programme highlighting
interesting problems and stimulating the search for novel ways of describing
related biological phenomena. In addition, we had an invited talk given by Luca
Cardelli on a spatial process algebra for developmental biology. Membrane
systems were introduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices
inspired by the observation that any biological system is a complex
hierarchical structure, with a flow of materials and information that underlies
their functioning. The emphasis is on the computational properties of the
model, and it makes use of automata, languages, and complexity theoretic tools.
On the other hand, certain calculi such as mobile ambients and brane calculi
work with similar notions (compartments, membranes). These calculi are used to
model and analyze the various biological systems. The workshop on Membrane

computerised simulations of biological systems, which are called in silico

behaviour with a considerably lower cost. Computer visualisation is an
important part of this approach, since it provides a realistic representation
of the system behaviour. We define a formal methodology to model biological
systems using different levels of representation: a purely formal
representation, which we call molecular level, models the biochemical dynamics
of the system; visualisation-oriented representations, which we call visual
levels, provide views of the biological system at a higher level of
organisation and are equipped with the necessary spatial information to
generate the appropriate visualisation. We choose Spatial CLS, a formal
language belonging to the class of Calculi of Looping Sequences, as the
formalism for modelling all representation levels. We illustrate our approach

of the major losses of biodiversity in the history of life on Earth remain
elusive. A variety of possible causes for these mass-extinction events have
been investigated, including impacts of asteroids or comets, large-scale
volcanic eruptions, effects from changes in the distribution of continents
caused by plate tectonics, and biological factors, to name but a few. Many of
these suggested drivers involve or indeed require changes of the Earth's
climate, which then affect the biosphere of our planet causing a global
reduction in the diversity of biological species. It can be argued, therefore,
that a detailed understanding of these climatic variations and their effects on
ecosystems are prerequisites for a solution to the enigma of biological
extinctions. Apart from investigations of paleoclimate data of the time periods
of mass extinctions, climate-modelling experiments should be able to shed some
light on these dramatic events. Somewhat surprisingly, however, only few
comprehensive modelling studies of the climate changes associated with
extinction events have been undertaken. These studies will be reviewed in this

biological processes is of huge interest for researchers due to the resonant
change of the intensity of biochemical reactions although the energy in such
fields is small. A simplified model to study the effect of the weak magnetic
and electrical fields on fluctuation of the random ionic currents in blood and
to solve the $k_BT$ problem in magnetobiology is suggested. The analytic
expression for the kinetic energy of the molecules dissolved in certain liquid
media is obtained. The values of the magnetic field leading to resonant effects
in capillaries are estimated. The numerical estimates showed that the resonant
values of the energy of molecular in the capillaries and aorta are different:
under identical conditions a molecule of the aorta gets $10^{-9}$ times less
energy than the molecules in blood capillaries. So the capillaries are very
sensitive to the resonant effect, with an approach to the resonant value of the
magnetic field strength, the average energy of the molecule localized in the
capillary is increased by several orders of magnitude as compared to its
thermal energy, this value of the energy is sufficient for the deterioration of

conclusion on the existence of a resonance mechanism allowing weak magnetic
fields to affect biological processes. These fields may either be static
magnetic fields comparable in magnitude with the magnetic field of the earth or
weak ultra-low frequency time-dependent fields. So far, a generally accepted
theoretical model allowing one to understand the effect of magnetic and
electric fields on biological processes is not available. By this reason, it is
not clear which characteristics of the fields, like magnetic and electric field
strength, frequency of change of the field, shape of the electromagnetic wave,
the duration of the magnetic or electric influence or some particular
combination of them, are responsible for the biological effect. In the present
analysis it is shown that external time-independent magnetic fields may cause a
resonance amplification of ionic electric currents in biological tissues and,
in particular, in the vasculature system due to a Brownian motion of charges.
These resonance electric currents may cause necrotic changes in the tissues or
blood circulation and in this way significantly affect the biological organism.
The magnitude of the magnetic fields leading to resonance effects is estimated,
it is shown that it depends significantly on the radius of the blood
capillaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.1198v1,physics.bio-ph

use of information. In order to build new knowledge, various sources of
biological data must often be combined. Semantic Web technologies, which
provide a common framework allowing data to be shared and reused between
applications, can be applied to the management of disseminated biological data.
However, due to some specificities of biological data, the application of these
technologies to life science constitutes a real challenge. Through a use case
of biological data integration, we show in this paper that current Semantic Web
technologies start to become mature and can be applied for the development of
large applications. However, in order to get the best from these technologies,
improvements are needed both at the level of tool performance and knowledge

properties and have been intensively explored for biological and biomedical
applications. In this review, we summarize the main results of our and other
groups in this field and clarify that surface functionalization is critical to
the behaviors of carbon nanotubes in biological systems. Ultra-sensitive
detection of biological species with carbon nanotubes can be realized after
surface passivation to inhibit the non-specific binding of bio-molecules on the
hydrophobic nanotube surface. Electrical nanosensors based on nanotubes provide
a label-free approach to biological detections. Surface enhanced Raman
spectroscopy of CNT opens up a method of protein microarray with down to 1 fM
detection sensitivity. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies reveal that well
water soluble and serum stable nanotubes are biocompatible, non-toxic and
potentially useful for biomedical applications. In vivo biodistributions vary
with the functionalization and possibly also sizes of nanotubes, with a
tendency of accumulation in the reticuloendothelial systems, including the
liver and spleen, after intravenous administration. If well functionalized,
nanotubes may be excreted mainly through the biliary pathway in feces. Carbon
nanotube-based drug delivery has shown promises in various in vitro and in vivo
experiments including delivery pf small interfering RNA, paclitaxel and
doxorubicin. Moreover, SWNTs with various interesting intrinsic optical
properties have been used as novel photoluminance, Raman and photoacoustic

enable statistically significant measurements of spatial organization within

paper, we introduce an Automated Neuron Recognition Algorithm (ANRA) which
obtains the (x,y) location of individual neurons within digitized images of
Nissl-stained, 30 micron thick, frozen sections of the cerebral cortex of the
Rhesus monkey. Identification of neurons within such Nissl-stained sections is
inherently difficult due to the variability in neuron staining, the overlap of
neurons, the presence of partial or damaged neurons at tissue surfaces, and the
presence of non-neuron objects, such as glial cells, blood vessels, and random
artifacts. To overcome these challenges and identify neurons, ANRA applies a
combination of image segmentation and machine learning. The steps involve
active contour segmentation to find outlines of potential neuron cell bodies
followed by artificial neural network training using the segmentation
properties (size, optical density, gyration, etc.) to distinguish between
neuron and non-neuron segmentations. ANRA positively identifies 86[5]% neurons
with 15[8]% error (mean[st.dev.]) on a wide range of Nissl-stained images,

ANRA is that it affords an unlimited increase in speed from semi-automatic

space. Quantitative lattices simulation finds that (1) decrease of extinction
possibility is exponential dependent on the increase of doping rate, (2) the
possibility of the conflict is independent of doping rate at well mix evolution

missions have enhanced our knowledge about the environmental conditions on the
Red Planet. However, the Martian surface chemistry and the Viking lander
results remain puzzling. Non-biological explanations that favor a strong
inorganic oxidant are currently favored (e.g., Mancinelli, 1989; Quinn and
Zent, 1999; Klein, 1999, Yen et al., 2000), but problems remain regarding the
life time, source, and abundance of that oxidant to account for the Viking
observations (Zent and McKay, 1994). Alternatively, a hypothesis favoring the
biological origin of a strong oxidizer has recently been advanced (Houtkooper

transcriptional profiling of a large number of genes in a given paradigm. Gene
expression estimation precedes biological inference and is given as a complex
combination of atomic entities on the array called probes. These probe
intensities are further classified into perfect-match (PM) and mis-match (MM)
probes. While former is a measure of specific binding, the lat-ter is a measure
of non-specific binding. The behavior of the MM probes has especially proven to
be elusive. The present study investigates qualita-tive similarities in the
distributional signatures and local correlation struc-tures/patchiness between
the PM and MM probe intensities. These qualita-tive similarities are
established on publicly available microarrays generated across laboratories
investigating the same paradigm. Persistence of these similarities across raw
as well as background subtracted probe intensities is also investigated. The
results presented raise fundamental concerns in inter-preting Genechip
oligonucleotide microarray data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1152v2,q-bio.GN

been discovered emerging from seeds of the persistent pods of Acacia caven
attacked by the univoltin bruchid Pseudopachymeria spinipes. We investigated
the potential for mass rearing of this gregarious ectoparasitoid on an
alternative bruchid host, Callosobruchus maculatus, to use it against the
bruchidae of native and cultured species of Leguminosea seeds in South America.
The mass rearing of M.dorsiplana was carried out in a population cage where the
density of egg-laying females per infested seed was increased from 1:1 on the
first day to 5:1 on the last (fifth) day. Under these experimental conditions
egg-clutch size per host increased, and at the same time the mortality of eggs
laid also increased. The density of egg-laying females influenced the sex ratio
which tended towards a balance of sons and daughters,in contrast to the sex
ratio of a single egg-laying female per host (1 son to 7 daughters). The mean
weight of adults emerging from a parasitized host was negatively correlated
with the egg-clutch size, i.e., as egg-clutch size increased, adult weight
decreased. All these results show that mass rearing of the gregarious
ectoparasitoid M.dorsiplana was possible under laboratory conditions on an
alternative bruchid host C.maculatus. As M.dorsiplana is a natural enemy of
larval and pupal stages of bruchidae, the next step was to investigate whether

direction than the other. We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment that
for a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arise
solely from an asymmetry in the geometry of the pores of the membrane. Our
deterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks of
two sizes diffusing through a membrane, and our laboratory experiment examines
the diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In both
experiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smaller
particles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion rates
of these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particles
can clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one direction
while permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction. The
purely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in common biological

of alpha (Slater's [Phys. Rev. 81, 385 (1951)] exchange parameter) values has

the growth of the primary tumor, represents a fundamental issue in cancer
biology. Using an in vivo mammalian model, we show here that one can obtain
useful information from the frequency distribution of the sizes of metastatic
colonies in distant organs after serial sectioning and image reconstruction. To
explain the experimental findings, we constructed a biophysical model based on
the respective growth patterns of the primary tumor and metastases and a
stochastic process of metastatic colony formation. Heterogeneous distributions
of various biological parameters were considered. We found that the elementary
assumption of exponential forms of growth for the primary tumor and metastatic
colonies predicts a linear relation on a log-log plot of a metastatic colony
size distribution, which was consistent with the experimental results.
Furthermore, the slope of the curve signifies the ratio of growth rates of the
primary and the metastases. Non-exponential (Gompertzian and logistic) tumor
growth patterns were also incorporated into the theory to explain possible
deviation from the log-log linear relation. The observed metastasis-free
probability also supported the assumption of a time-dependent Poisson process.
With this approach, we determined the mechanistic parameters governing the
process of metastatogenesis in the lungs for two murine tumor cell lines (KHT

provides many natural laboratories such as planetary rings, comet comae and
tails, ejecta clouds around moons and asteroids, and Earth's noctilucent clouds
for which to closely study plasma-embedded cosmic dust. One natural laboratory
to study electromagnetically-controlled cosmic dust has been provided by the
Jovian dust streams and the data from the instruments which were on board the

Jovian magnetosphere by Io and its volcanoes resulting in the dust streams, the
possibility of dusty plasma conditions exist. This paper characterizes the main
parameters for those interested in studying dust embedded in a plasma with a
focus on the Jupiter environment. I show how to distinguish between
dust-in-plasma and dusty-plasma and how the Havnes parameter P can be used to
support or negate the possibility of collective behavior of the dusty plasma.
The result of applying these tools to the Jovian dust streams reveals mostly
dust-in-plasma behavior. In the orbits displaying the highest dust stream
fluxes, portions of orbits E4, G7, G8, C21 satisfy the minimum requirements for

expression of genes in a given biological paradigm. Probes on the Genechip
array are atomic entities which by definition are randomly distributed across
the array and in turn govern the gene expression. In the present study, we make
several interesting observations. We show that there is considerable
correlation between the probe intensities across the array which defy the
independence assumption. While the mechanism behind such correlations is
unclear, we show that scaling behavior and the profiles of perfect match (PM)
as well as mismatch (MM) probes are similar and immune to background
subtraction. We believe that the observed correlations are possibly an outcome
of inherent non-stationarities or patchiness in the array devoid of biological
significance. This is demonstrated by inspecting their scaling behavior and
profiles of the PM and MM probe intensities obtained from publicly available
Genechip arrays from three eukaryotic genomes, namely: Drosophila Melanogaster,
Homo Sapiens and Mus musculus across distinct biological paradigms and across
laboratories, with and without background subtraction. The fluctuation
functions were estimated using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) with fourth
order polynomial detrending. The results presented in this study provide new

lavas of the Earth following the 3.8 Ga pillow basalts at Isua and they
represent some of the oldest ultramafic magmatic rocks preserved in the Earth's
crust at 3.5 Ga. This fact, linked to their particular features (high magnesium
content, high melting temperatures, low dynamic viscosities, etc.), has
attracted the community of geoscientists since their discovery in the early
sixties, who have tried to determine their origin and understand their meaning
in the context of the terrestrial mantle evolution. In addition, it has been
proposed that komatiites are not restricted to our planet, but they could be
found in other extraterrestrial setting in our Solar System (particularly in
Mars and Io). It is important to note that komatiites may be extremely
significant in the study of the origins and evolution of Life on Earth. They
not only preserve essential geochemical clues of the interaction between the
pristine Earth rocks and atmosphere, but also may have been potential suitable
sites for biological processes to develop. Thus, besides reviewing the main
geodynamic, petrological and geochemical characteristics of komatiites, this
paper also aims to widen their investigation beyond the classical geological
prospect, calling attention to them as attracting rocks for research in
planetology and astrobiology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0512118v2,physics.geo-ph

that the neutron comprised a proton and an electron was diffusely taken into
account after the discovery of the neutron. Moreover, uncertainties persisted
about the composition of beryllium radiation until it was realized that the
latter comprised both neutrons and gamma-rays. The interaction of neutrons with
matter and nuclei was soon investigated. Both a spatial symmetry, a symmetry of
charge, and a symmetry in the nuclear reactions soon emerged. The relation of
negative beta-decay to the neutron abundance in nuclei was moreover reviewed.
Positive beta-radioactivity induced by alpha-particles was eventually
announced, having been foreseen some weeks before. Accelerated deutons and
protons shortly afterwards revealed to be efficient in inducing radioactivity.
The physics institute in Rome got ready to start research on neutrons, but
apparently it only planned to go through alpha-induced radioactivity, at first.
If so, it is then plausible that some new results achieved by foreign
laboratories eventually bent Fermi to neutrons. Fermi's discovery of
neutron-induced radioactivity is reviewed with regard to investigations then
current, once more showing simplicity as a distinctive trait of Fermi's way of
doing physics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0510044v1,physics.hist-ph

Despite almost eighty years of intense scientific inquiry, no clear
understanding of this fundamental aspect of turbulence has emerged. One
critical unresolved question is the extent to which the initial separation of
the fluid particles influences their subsequent motion. Surprisingly, our
measurements in a laboratory water flow at very high turbulence levels (Taylor
microscale Reynolds numbers up to R_lambda = 815) suggest that the initial
separation remains important for all but the most violent flows on Earth. This

strong hard X-ray emission were selected. Among them, 40 flares were further
found to show significant gamma-ray emission. A fractal dimension analysis and
multi-band color--color plots of the 40 flares suggest that their soft X-ray to

involved in reaction are small, with only P$_\gamma$ and the catalytic proton

the active site cleft is not completely closed and there is insufficient space

Coulomb interaction U_{d} and a Lanczos matrix diagonalization routine to solve
for eigenvalues. The model parameters are constrained by fits to the partial
density of states (PDOS) obtained from ab initio density functional theory

incubation times in infectious prion diseases. The central feature of our model
is that slow growth of misfolded protein-aggregates from small initial seeds
controls the `latent' or `lag' phase, whereas aggregate-fissioning and
subsequent spreading leads to an exponential growth or doubling phase. Such a
general framework can account for many features of prion diseases including the
striking reproducibility of incubation times when high doses are inoculated
into lab animals. Broad incubation time distributions arise for low infectious
dose, while our calculated distributions narrow to sharply defined onset times
with increased dose. We apply our distributions to epidemiological vCJD data

the presence of cryoprotectors: dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol. Three types of
phospholipid membranes: DPPC, DMPC, DSPC are chosen for the investigation as
well-studied model biological membranes. A special cryostat is used for sample
cooling from 14.1C to -55.4C. The ice formation is only detected by WAXS in
binary phospholipid/water and ternary phospholipid/cryoprotector/water systems
in the condition of excess solvent. Ice formation in a binary
phospholipid/water system creates an abrupt decrease of the membrane repeat
distance by delta-d, so-called ice-induced dehydration of intermembrane space.
The value of delta-d decreases as the cryoprotector concentration increases.
The formation of ice does not influence the membrane structure (delta-d = 0)

attraction. The transition from diffusive to saturated regimes of the linear
model is understood as a crossover phenomenon, and the robustness of the linear

magnetoresistance above the Curie transition at T$_C$ = 112 K, show that spins
in neighboring layers within each bilayer are strongly canted at an average
angle that is dependent on both the magnetic field and temperature, as

some or all internal symmetries of the native protein are spontaneously broken.
Hence, the free-energy potential corresponding to a folding-funnel landscape
becomes temperature-dependent and describes a phase transition. The idea that
deformed vortices could be produced in the transition induced by temperature
quenching, from native proteins to unfolded conformations is discussed in terms
of the Zurek mechanism that implements the analogy between vortices, created in
the laboratory at low energy, and the cosmic strings which are thought to have
been left after symmetry breaking phase transitions in the early universe. An
experiment is proposed to test the above idea which generalizes the
cosmological analogy to also encompass biological systems and push a step ahead

1997-01-22 05:10:06+00:00,Self-Organized Criticality and Punctuated Equilibria,"['Per Bak', 'Stefan Boettcher']","Many natural phenomena evolve intermittently, with periods of tranquillity
interrupted by bursts of activity, rather than following a smooth gradual path.
Examples include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, solar flares, gamma-ray
bursts, and biological evolution. Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge have
coined the term ""punctuated equilibria"" for this behavior. We argue that
punctuated equilibria reflects the tendency of dynamical systems to evolve
towards a critical state, and review recent work on simple models. A good
metaphoric picture is one where the systems are temporarily trapped in valleys
of deformable, interacting landscapes. Similarities with spin glasses are
pointed out. Punctuated equilibria are essential for the emergence of complex
phenomena. The periods of stasis allow the system to remember its past history;
yet the intermittent events permit further change.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9701157v1,cond-mat
1996-03-04 03:33:44+00:00,Ultrametricity and Memory in a Solvable Model of Self-Organized Criticality,"['Stefan Boettcher', 'Maya Paczuski']","Slowly driven dissipative systems may evolve to a critical state where long
periods of apparent equilibrium are punctuated by intermittent avalanches of
activity. We present a self-organized critical model of punctuated equilibrium
behavior in the context of biological evolution, and solve it in the limit that
the number of independent traits for each species diverges. We derive an exact
equation of motion for the avalanche dynamics from the microscopic rules. In
the continuum limit, avalanches propagate via a diffusion equation with a
nonlocal, history-dependent potential representing memory. This nonlocal
potential gives rise to a non-Gaussian (fat) tail for the subdiffusive
spreading of activity. The probability for the activity to spread beyond a
distance $r$ in time $s$ decays as $\sqrt{24\over\pi}s^{-3/2}x^{1/3}
\exp{[-{3\over 4}x^{1/3}]}$ for $x={r^4\over s} \gg 1$. The potential
represents a hierarchy of time scales that is dynamically generated by the
ultrametric structure of avalanches, which can be quantified in terms of
``backward'' avalanches. In addition, a number of other correlation functions
characterizing the punctuated equilibrium dynamics are determined exactly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9603018v1,cond-mat

tubules and helical ribbons of chiral lipid membranes. This theory is based on
a continuum elastic free energy that permits variations in the direction of
molecular tilt and in the curvature of the membrane. The theory shows that the
formation of tubules and helical ribbons is driven by the chirality of the
membrane. Tubules have a first-order transition from a uniform state to a
helically modulated state, with periodic stripes in the tilt direction and
ripples in the curvature. Helical ribbons can be stable structures, or they can
be unstable intermediate states in the formation of tubules.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9510025v2,cond-mat

locally acting organisms is proposed in which organisms move probabilistically
between local cells in space, but with weights dependent on local morphogenetic
substances, or morphogens. The morphogens are in turn are effected by the
passage of an organism. The evolution of the morphogens, and the corresponding
flow of the organisms constitutes the collective behavior of the group. Such
models have various types of phase transitions and self-organizing properties
controlled both by the level of the noise, and other parameters.
  The model is then applied to the specific case of ants moving on a lattice.
The local behavior of the ants is inspired by the actual behavior observed in
the laboratory, and analytic results for the collective behavior are compared
to the corresponding laboratory results.
  It is hoped that the present model might serve as a paradigmatic example of a
complex cooperative system in nature. In particular swarm models can be used to
explore the relation of nonequilibrium phase transitions to at least three
important issues encountered in artificial life. Firstly, that of emergence as
complex adaptive behavior. Secondly, as an exploration of continuous phase
transitions in biological systems. Lastly, to derive behavioral criteria for
the evolution of collective behavior in social organisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/adap-org/9306002v1,adap-org
