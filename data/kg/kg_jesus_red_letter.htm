"[Matthew 3:15] Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\n[Matthew 4:4] It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\n[Matthew 4:7] It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\n[Matthew 4:10] Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\n[Matthew 4:17] Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\n[Matthew 4:19] Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.\n[Matthew 5:3] Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 5:4] Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.\n[Matthew 5:5] Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.\n[Matthew 5:6] Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\n[Matthew 5:7] Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.\n[Matthew 5:8] Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\n[Matthew 5:9] Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.\n[Matthew 5:10] Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 5:11] Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n[Matthew 5:12] Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.\n[Matthew 5:13] Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted?\n[Matthew 5:13] it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.\n[Matthew 5:14] Ye are the light of the world.\n[Matthew 5:14] A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\n[Matthew 5:15] Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.\n[Matthew 5:16] Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 5:17] Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\n[Matthew 5:18] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\n[Matthew 5:19] Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 5:20] For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 5:21] Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:\n[Matthew 5:22] But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\n[Matthew 5:23] Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;\n[Matthew 5:24] Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.\n[Matthew 5:25] Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.\n[Matthew 5:26] Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\n[Matthew 5:27] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:\n[Matthew 5:28] But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\n[Matthew 5:29] And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\n[Matthew 5:30] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.\n[Matthew 5:31] It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:\n[Matthew 5:32] But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\n[Matthew 5:33] Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:\n[Matthew 5:34] But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:\n[Matthew 5:35] Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.\n[Matthew 5:36] Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.\n[Matthew 5:37] But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\n[Matthew 5:38] Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:\n[Matthew 5:39] But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\n[Matthew 5:40] And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.\n[Matthew 5:41] And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.\n[Matthew 5:42] Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.\n[Matthew 5:43] Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.\n[Matthew 5:44] But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;\n[Matthew 5:45] That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\n[Matthew 5:46] For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?\n[Matthew 5:46] do not even the publicans the same?\n[Matthew 5:47] And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?\n[Matthew 5:47] do not even the publicans so?\n[Matthew 5:48] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\n[Matthew 6:1] Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 6:2] Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men.\n[Matthew 6:2] Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n[Matthew 6:3] But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:\n[Matthew 6:4] That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.\n[Matthew 6:5] And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.\n[Matthew 6:5] Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n[Matthew 6:6] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.\n[Matthew 6:7] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\n[Matthew 6:8] Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.\n[Matthew 6:9] After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n[Matthew 6:10] Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\n[Matthew 6:11] Give us this day our daily bread.\n[Matthew 6:12] And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\n[Matthew 6:13] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.\n[Matthew 6:13] Amen.\n[Matthew 6:14] For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:\n[Matthew 6:15] But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\n[Matthew 6:16] Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.\n[Matthew 6:16] Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.\n[Matthew 6:17] But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;\n[Matthew 6:18] That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\n[Matthew 6:19] Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:\n[Matthew 6:20] But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:\n[Matthew 6:21] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n[Matthew 6:22] The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\n[Matthew 6:23] But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.\n[Matthew 6:23] If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\n[Matthew 6:24] No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.\n[Matthew 6:24] Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n[Matthew 6:25] Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.\n[Matthew 6:25] Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\n[Matthew 6:26] Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.\n[Matthew 6:26] Are ye not much better than they?\n[Matthew 6:27] Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?\n[Matthew 6:28] And why take ye thought for raiment?\n[Matthew 6:28] Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:\n[Matthew 6:29] And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n[Matthew 6:30] Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\n[Matthew 6:31] Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?\n[Matthew 6:31] or, What shall we drink?\n[Matthew 6:31] or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?\n[Matthew 6:32] (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.\n[Matthew 6:33] But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\n[Matthew 6:34] Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.\n[Matthew 6:34] Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\n[Matthew 7:1] Judge not, that ye be not judged.\n[Matthew 7:2] For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n[Matthew 7:3] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n[Matthew 7:4] Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\n[Matthew 7:5] Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\n[Matthew 7:6] Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.\n[Matthew 7:7] Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:\n[Matthew 7:8] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\n[Matthew 7:9] Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?\n[Matthew 7:10] Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\n[Matthew 7:11] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?\n[Matthew 7:12] Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.\n[Matthew 7:13] Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:\n[Matthew 7:14] Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\n[Matthew 7:15] Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\n[Matthew 7:16] Ye shall know them by their fruits.\n[Matthew 7:16] Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\n[Matthew 7:17] Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.\n[Matthew 7:18] A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\n[Matthew 7:19] Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.\n[Matthew 7:20] Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\n[Matthew 7:21] Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 7:22] Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?\n[Matthew 7:22] and in thy name have cast out devils?\n[Matthew 7:22] and in thy name done many wonderful works?\n[Matthew 7:23] And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\n[Matthew 7:24] Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:\n[Matthew 7:25] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.\n[Matthew 7:26] And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:\n[Matthew 7:27] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.\n[Matthew 8:3] I will; be thou clean.\n[Matthew 8:4] See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\n[Matthew 8:7] I will come and heal him.\n[Matthew 8:10] Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\n[Matthew 8:11] And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 8:12] But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n[Matthew 8:13] Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.\n[Matthew 8:20] The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\n[Matthew 8:22] Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.\n[Matthew 8:26] Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?\n[Matthew 8:32] Go.\n[Matthew 9:2] Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.\n[Matthew 9:4] Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?\n[Matthew 9:5] For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?\n[Matthew 9:6] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\n[Matthew 9:9] Follow me.\n[Matthew 9:12] They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.\n[Matthew 9:13] But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\n[Matthew 9:15] Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?\n[Matthew 9:15] but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.\n[Matthew 9:16] No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.\n[Matthew 9:17] Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.\n[Matthew 9:22] Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.", "chunk_size": 8191, "chunk_index": 0, "cut_type": "paragraph_end", "id": "e37a2b5b-db4e-5954-b2ef-4bfef8612988", "color":

it unto you.\n[Matthew 9:30] See that no man know it.\n[Matthew 9:37] Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;\n[Matthew 9:38] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.\n[Matthew 10:5] Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:\n[Matthew 10:6] But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n[Matthew 10:7] And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\n[Matthew 10:8] Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\n[Matthew 10:9] Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,\n[Matthew 10:10] Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.\n[Matthew 10:11] And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.\n[Matthew 10:12] And when ye come into an house, salute it.\n[Matthew 10:13] And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.\n[Matthew 10:14] And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.\n[Matthew 10:15] Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.\n[Matthew 10:16] Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\n[Matthew 10:17] But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;\n[Matthew 10:18] And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.\n[Matthew 10:19] But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.\n[Matthew 10:20] For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\n[Matthew 10:21] And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.\n[Matthew 10:22] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.\n[Matthew 10:23] But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.\n[Matthew 10:24] The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.\n[Matthew 10:25] It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.\n[Matthew 10:25] If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?\n[Matthew 10:26] Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.\n[Matthew 10:27] What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.\n[Matthew 10:28] And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\n[Matthew 10:29] Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?\n[Matthew 10:29] and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.\n[Matthew 10:30] But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\n[Matthew 10:31] Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\n[Matthew 10:32] Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 10:33] But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 10:34] Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n[Matthew 10:35] For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n[Matthew 10:36] And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\n[Matthew 10:37] He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\n[Matthew 10:38] And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.\n[Matthew 10:39] He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.\n[Matthew 10:40] He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.\n[Matthew 10:41] He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.\n[Matthew 10:42] And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.\n[Matthew 11:4] Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:\n[Matthew 11:5] The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.\n[Matthew 11:6] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\n[Matthew 11:7] What went ye out into the wilderness to see?\n[Matthew 11:7] A reed shaken with the wind?\n[Matthew 11:8] But what went ye out for to see?\n[Matthew 11:8] A man clothed in soft raiment?\n[Matthew 11:8] behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.\n[Matthew 11:9] But what went ye out for to see?\n[Matthew 11:9] A prophet?\n[Matthew 11:9] yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.\n[Matthew 11:10] For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\n[Matthew 11:11] Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\n[Matthew 11:12] And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.\n[Matthew 11:13] For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.\n[Matthew 11:14] And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\n[Matthew 11:15] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Matthew 11:16] But whereunto shall I liken this generation?\n[Matthew 11:16] It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,\n[Matthew 11:17] And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.\n[Matthew 11:18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.\n[Matthew 11:19] The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.\n[Matthew 11:19] But wisdom is justified of her children.\n[Matthew 11:21] Woe unto thee, Chorazin!\n[Matthew 11:21] woe unto thee, Bethsaida!\n[Matthew 11:21] for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\n[Matthew 11:22] But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.\n[Matthew 11:23] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.\n[Matthew 11:24] But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\n[Matthew 11:25] I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.\n[Matthew 11:26] Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n[Matthew 11:27] All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\n[Matthew 11:28] Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n[Matthew 11:29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n[Matthew 11:30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\n[Matthew 12:3] Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;\n[Matthew 12:4] How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?\n[Matthew 12:5] Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?\n[Matthew 12:6] But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.\n[Matthew 12:7] But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.\n[Matthew 12:8] For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.\n[Matthew 12:11] What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?\n[Matthew 12:12] How much then is a man better than a sheep?\n[Matthew 12:12] Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.\n[Matthew 12:13] Stretch forth thine hand.\n[Matthew 12:25] Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:\n[Matthew 12:26] And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?\n[Matthew 12:27] And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?\n[Matthew 12:27] therefore they shall be your judges.\n[Matthew 12:28] But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.\n[Matthew 12:29] Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?\n[Matthew 12:29] and then he will spoil his house.\n[Matthew 12:30] He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\n[Matthew 12:31] Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.\n[Matthew 12:32] And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\n[Matthew 12:33] Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.\n[Matthew 12:34] O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?\n[Matthew 12:34] for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\n[Matthew 12:35] A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.\n[Matthew 12:36] But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n[Matthew 12:37] For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\n[Matthew 12:39] An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:\n[Matthew 12:40] For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\n[Matthew 12:41] The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\n[Matthew 12:42] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.\n[Matthew 12:43] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.\n[Matthew 12:44] Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.\n[Matthew 12:45] Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.\n[Matthew 12:45] Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.\n[Matthew 12:48] Who is my mother?\n[Matthew 12:48] and who are my brethren?\n[Matthew 12:49] Behold my mother and my brethren!\n[Matthew 12:50] For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.\n[Matthew 13:3] Behold, a sower went forth to sow;\n[Matthew 13:4] And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:\n[Matthew 13:5] Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:\n[Matthew 13:6] And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.\n[Matthew 13:7] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:\n[Matthew 13:8] But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.\n[Matthew 13:9] Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Matthew 13:11] Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.\n[Matthew 13:12] For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.\n[Matthew 13:13] Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\n[Matthew 13:14] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:\n[Matthew 13:15] For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.\n[Matthew 13:16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.\n[Matthew 13:17] For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.\n[Matthew 13:18] Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.\n[Matthew 13:19] When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.\n[Matthew 13:19] This is he which received seed by the way side.\n[Matthew 13:20] But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;\n[Matthew 13:21] Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.\n[Matthew 13:22] He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.\n[Matthew 13:23] But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\n[Matthew 13:24] The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:\n[Matthew 13:25] But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.\n[Matthew 13:26] But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.\n[Matthew 13:27] So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?\n[Matthew 13:27] from whence then hath it tares?\n[Matthew 13:28] He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.\n[Matthew 13:28] The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?\n[Matthew 13:29] But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.\n[Matthew 13:30] Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.\n[Matthew 13:31] The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:\n[Matthew 13:32] Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.\n[Matthew 13:33] The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.\n[Matthew 13:37] He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;\n[Matthew 13:38] The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;", "chunk_size": 8190, "chunk_index": 1, "cut_type": "paragraph_end", "id": "d7c11efb-d22c-50ea-a04a-335e671c20b5",

are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.\n[Matthew 13:41] The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;\n[Matthew 13:42] And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n[Matthew 13:43] Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.\n[Matthew 13:43] Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Matthew 13:44] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.\n[Matthew 13:45] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\n[Matthew 13:46] Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n[Matthew 13:47] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:\n[Matthew 13:48] Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.\n[Matthew 13:49] So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,\n[Matthew 13:50] And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\n[Matthew 13:51] Have ye understood all these things?\n[Matthew 13:52] Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.\n[Matthew 13:57] A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.\n[Matthew 14:16] They need not depart; give ye them to eat.\n[Matthew 14:18] Bring them hither to me.\n[Matthew 14:27] Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.\n[Matthew 14:29] Come.\n[Matthew 14:31] O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\n[Matthew 15:3] Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?\n[Matthew 15:4] For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.\n[Matthew 15:5] But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;\n[Matthew 15:6] And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.\n[Matthew 15:6] Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.\n[Matthew 15:7] Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,\n[Matthew 15:8] This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.\n[Matthew 15:9] But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\n[Matthew 15:10] Hear, and understand:\n[Matthew 15:11] Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.\n[Matthew 15:13] Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.\n[Matthew 15:14] Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.\n[Matthew 15:14] And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.\n[Matthew 15:16] Are ye also yet without understanding?\n[Matthew 15:17] Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?\n[Matthew 15:18] But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.\n[Matthew 15:19] For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:\n[Matthew 15:20] These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.\n[Matthew 15:24] I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n[Matthew 15:26] It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.\n[Matthew 15:28] O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\n[Matthew 15:32] I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.\n[Matthew 15:34] How many loaves have ye?\n[Matthew 16:2] When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.\n[Matthew 16:3] And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering.\n[Matthew 16:3] O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?\n[Matthew 16:4] A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.\n[Matthew 16:6] Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.\n[Matthew 16:8] O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?\n[Matthew 16:9] Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?\n[Matthew 16:10] Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?\n[Matthew 16:11] How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?\n[Matthew 16:13] Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?\n[Matthew 16:15] But whom say ye that I am?\n[Matthew 16:17] Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 16:18] And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\n[Matthew 16:19] And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n[Matthew 16:23] Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\n[Matthew 16:24] If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\n[Matthew 16:25] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\n[Matthew 16:26] For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n[Matthew 16:26] or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\n[Matthew 16:27] For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.\n[Matthew 16:28] Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\n[Matthew 17:7] Arise, and be not afraid.\n[Matthew 17:9] Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.\n[Matthew 17:11] Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.\n[Matthew 17:12] But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.\n[Matthew 17:12] Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.\n[Matthew 17:17] O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?\n[Matthew 17:17] how long shall I suffer you?\n[Matthew 17:17] bring him hither to me.\n[Matthew 17:20] Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\n[Matthew 17:21] Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.\n[Matthew 17:22] The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:\n[Matthew 17:23] And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.\n[Matthew 17:25] What thinkest thou, Simon?\n[Matthew 17:25] of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?\n[Matthew 17:25] of their own children, or of strangers?\n[Matthew 17:26] Then are the children free.\n[Matthew 17:27] Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.\n[Matthew 18:3] Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 18:4] Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 18:5] And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.\n[Matthew 18:6] But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\n[Matthew 18:7] Woe unto the world because of offences!\n[Matthew 18:7] for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!\n[Matthew 18:8] Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.\n[Matthew 18:9] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.\n[Matthew 18:10] Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 18:11] For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.\n[Matthew 18:12] How think ye?\n[Matthew 18:12] if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?\n[Matthew 18:13] And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.\n[Matthew 18:14] Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.\n[Matthew 18:15] Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.\n[Matthew 18:16] But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\n[Matthew 18:17] And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.\n[Matthew 18:18] Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n[Matthew 18:19] Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 18:20] For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.\n[Matthew 18:22] I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.\n[Matthew 18:23] Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.\n[Matthew 18:24] And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.\n[Matthew 18:25] But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.\n[Matthew 18:26] The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n[Matthew 18:27] Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.\n[Matthew 18:28] But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.\n[Matthew 18:29] And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n[Matthew 18:30] And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.\n[Matthew 18:31] So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.\n[Matthew 18:32] Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:\n[Matthew 18:33] Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?\n[Matthew 18:34] And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.\n[Matthew 18:35] So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.\n[Matthew 19:4] Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,\n[Matthew 19:5] And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?\n[Matthew 19:6] Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.\n[Matthew 19:6] What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\n[Matthew 19:8] Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.\n[Matthew 19:9] And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.\n[Matthew 19:11] All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.\n[Matthew 19:12] For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\n[Matthew 19:12] He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\n[Matthew 19:14] Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 19:17] Why callest thou me good?\n[Matthew 19:17] there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\n[Matthew 19:18] Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,\n[Matthew 19:19] Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n[Matthew 19:21] If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\n[Matthew 19:23] Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.\n[Matthew 19:24] And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n[Matthew 19:26] With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.\n[Matthew 19:28] Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n[Matthew 19:29] And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.\n[Matthew 19:30] But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.\n[Matthew 20:1] For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.\n[Matthew 20:2] And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.\n[Matthew 20:3] And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,\n[Matthew 20:4] And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you.\n[Matthew 20:4] And they went their way.\n[Matthew 20:5] Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.\n[Matthew 20:6] And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?\n[Matthew 20:7] They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us.\n[Matthew 20:7] He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.\n[Matthew 20:8] So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.\n[Matthew 20:9] And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.\n[Matthew 20:10] But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.\n[Matthew 20:11] And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,\n[Matthew 20:12] Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.\n[Matthew 20:13] But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?\n[Matthew 20:14] Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.\n[Matthew 20:15] Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?", "chunk_size": 8182, "chunk_index": 2,

20:19] And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.\n[Matthew 20:21] What wilt thou?\n[Matthew 20:22] Ye know not what ye

baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.\n[Matthew

this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.\n[Matthew 21:22] And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\n[Matthew 21:24] I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.\n[Matthew 21:25] The baptism of John, whence was it?\n[Matthew 21:25] from heaven, or of men?\n[Matthew 21:27] Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.\n[Matthew 21:28] But what think ye?\n[Matthew 21:28] A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.\n[Matthew 21:29] He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.\n[Matthew 21:30] And he came to the second, and said likewise.\n[Matthew 21:30] And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.\n[Matthew 21:31] Whether of them twain did the will of his father?\n[Matthew 21:31] Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.\n[Matthew 21:32] For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.\n[Matthew 21:33] Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:\n[Matthew 21:34] And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.\n[Matthew 21:35] And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.\n[Matthew 21:36] Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.\n[Matthew 21:37] But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.\n[Matthew 21:38] But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.\n[Matthew 21:39] And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.\n[Matthew 21:40] When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?\n[Matthew 21:42] Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?\n[Matthew 21:43] Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.\n[Matthew 21:44] And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\n[Matthew 22:2] The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,\n[Matthew 22:3] And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.\n[Matthew 22:4] Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.\n[Matthew 22:5] But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:\n[Matthew 22:6] And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.\n[Matthew 22:7] But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.\n[Matthew 22:8] Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.\n[Matthew 22:9] Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.\n[Matthew 22:10] So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.\n[Matthew 22:11] And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:\n[Matthew 22:12] And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?\n[Matthew 22:12] And he was speechless.\n[Matthew 22:13] Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n[Matthew 22:14] For many are called, but few are chosen.\n[Matthew 22:18] Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?\n[Matthew 22:19] Shew me the tribute money.\n[Matthew 22:20] Whose is this image and superscription?\n[Matthew 22:21] Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\n[Matthew 22:29] Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.\n[Matthew 22:30] For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.\n[Matthew 22:31] But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,\n[Matthew 22:32] I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\n[Matthew 22:32] God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.\n[Matthew 22:37] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.\n[Matthew 22:38] This is the first and great commandment.\n[Matthew 22:39] And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n[Matthew 22:40] On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\n[Matthew 22:42] What think ye of Christ?\n[Matthew 22:42] whose son is he?\n[Matthew 22:43] He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,\n[Matthew 22:44] The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?\n[Matthew 22:45] If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?\n[Matthew 23:2] The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:\n[Matthew 23:3] All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.\n[Matthew 23:4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.\n[Matthew 23:5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,\n[Matthew 23:6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,\n[Matthew 23:7] And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.\n[Matthew 23:8] But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.\n[Matthew 23:9] And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\n[Matthew 23:10] Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.\n[Matthew 23:11] But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\n[Matthew 23:12] And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.\n[Matthew 23:13] But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:13] for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\n[Matthew 23:14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:14] for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.\n[Matthew 23:15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:15] for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.\n[Matthew 23:16] Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!\n[Matthew 23:17] Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?\n[Matthew 23:18] And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.\n[Matthew 23:19] Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?\n[Matthew 23:20] Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.\n[Matthew 23:21] And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.\n[Matthew 23:22] And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.\n[Matthew 23:23] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:23] for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\n[Matthew 23:24] Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.\n[Matthew 23:25] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:25] for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.\n[Matthew 23:26] Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.\n[Matthew 23:27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:27] for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.\n[Matthew 23:28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\n[Matthew 23:29] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Matthew 23:29] because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,\n[Matthew 23:30] And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.\n[Matthew 23:31] Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.\n[Matthew 23:32] Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.\n[Matthew 23:33] Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?\n[Matthew 23:34] Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:\n[Matthew 23:35] That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.\n[Matthew 23:36] Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.\n[Matthew 23:37] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!\n[Matthew 23:38] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.\n[Matthew 23:39] For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\n[Matthew 24:2] See ye not all these things?\n[Matthew 24:2] verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.\n[Matthew 24:4] Take heed that no man deceive you.\n[Matthew 24:5] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\n[Matthew 24:6] And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.\n[Matthew 24:7] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.\n[Matthew 24:8] All these are the beginning of sorrows.\n[Matthew 24:9] Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.\n[Matthew 24:10] And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.\n[Matthew 24:11] And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.\n[Matthew 24:12] And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.\n[Matthew 24:13] But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n[Matthew 24:14] And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\n[Matthew 24:15] When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)\n[Matthew 24:16] Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:\n[Matthew 24:17] Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:\n[Matthew 24:18] Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.\n[Matthew 24:19] And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!\n[Matthew 24:20] But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:\n[Matthew 24:21] For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.\n[Matthew 24:22] And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.\n[Matthew 24:23] Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.\n[Matthew 24:24] For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.\n[Matthew 24:25] Behold, I have told you before.\n[Matthew 24:26] Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.\n[Matthew 24:27] For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\n[Matthew 24:28] For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.\n[Matthew 24:29] Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:\n[Matthew 24:30] And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.\n[Matthew 24:31] And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.\n[Matthew 24:32] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:\n[Matthew 24:33] So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.\n[Matthew 24:34] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.\n[Matthew 24:35] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\n[Matthew 24:36] But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.\n[Matthew 24:37] But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\n[Matthew 24:38] For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,\n[Matthew 24:39] And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\n[Matthew 24:40] Then shall two be in the field; ", "chunk_size": 8189, "chunk_index": 3,

women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.\n[Matthew 24:42] Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.\n[Matthew 24:43] But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.\n[Matthew 24:44] Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.\n[Matthew 24:45] Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?\n[Matthew 24:46] Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.\n[Matthew 24:47] Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.\n[Matthew 24:48] But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;\n[Matthew 24:49] And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;\n[Matthew 24:50] The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,\n[Matthew 24:51] And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n[Matthew 25:1] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.\n[Matthew 25:2] And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.\n[Matthew 25:3] They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:\n[Matthew 25:4] But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.\n[Matthew 25:5] While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\n[Matthew 25:6] And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\n[Matthew 25:7] Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.\n[Matthew 25:8] And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.\n[Matthew 25:9] But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.\n[Matthew 25:10] And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\n[Matthew 25:11] Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.\n[Matthew 25:12] But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.\n[Matthew 25:13] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.\n[Matthew 25:14] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.\n[Matthew 25:15] And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.\n[Matthew 25:16] Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.\n[Matthew 25:17] And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.\n[Matthew 25:18] But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.\n[Matthew 25:19] After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.\n[Matthew 25:20] And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.\n[Matthew 25:21] His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\n[Matthew 25:22] He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.\n[Matthew 25:23] His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\n[Matthew 25:24] Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:\n[Matthew 25:25] And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.\n[Matthew 25:26] His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:\n[Matthew 25:27] Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.\n[Matthew 25:28] Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.\n[Matthew 25:29] For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.\n[Matthew 25:30] And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n[Matthew 25:31] When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:\n[Matthew 25:32] And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:\n[Matthew 25:33] And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.\n[Matthew 25:34] Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:\n[Matthew 25:35] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:\n[Matthew 25:36] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.\n[Matthew 25:37] Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee?\n[Matthew 25:37] or thirsty, and gave thee drink?\n[Matthew 25:38] When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in?\n[Matthew 25:38] or naked, and clothed thee?\n[Matthew 25:39] Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\n[Matthew 25:40] And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\n[Matthew 25:41] Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:\n[Matthew 25:42] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:\n[Matthew 25:43] I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.\n[Matthew 25:44] Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?\n[Matthew 25:45] Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.\n[Matthew 25:46] And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\n[Matthew 26:2] Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.\n[Matthew 26:10] Why trouble ye the woman?\n[Matthew 26:10] for she hath wrought a good work upon me.\n[Matthew 26:11] For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.\n[Matthew 26:12] For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.\n[Matthew 26:13] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.\n[Matthew 26:18] Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.\n[Matthew 26:21] Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.\n[Matthew 26:23] And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.\n[Matthew 26:24] The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!\n[Matthew 26:24] it had been good for that man if he had not been born.\n[Matthew 26:25] Thou hast said.\n[Matthew 26:26] Take, eat; this is my body.\n[Matthew 26:27] Drink ye all of it;\n[Matthew 26:28] For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\n[Matthew 26:29] But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.\n[Matthew 26:31] All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.\n[Matthew 26:32] But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.\n[Matthew 26:34] Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.\n[Matthew 26:36] Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.\n[Matthew 26:38] My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.\n[Matthew 26:39] O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\n[Matthew 26:40] What, could ye not watch with me one hour?\n[Matthew 26:41] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\n[Matthew 26:42] O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.\n[Matthew 26:45] Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n[Matthew 26:46] Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.\n[Matthew 26:50] Friend, wherefore art thou come?\n[Matthew 26:52] Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.\n[Matthew 26:53] Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?\n[Matthew 26:54] But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\n[Matthew 26:55] Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?\n[Matthew 26:55] I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.\n[Matthew 26:56] But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.\n[Matthew 26:64] Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\n[Matthew 27:11] Thou sayest.\n[Matthew 27:46] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n[Matthew 28:9] All hail.\n[Matthew 28:10] Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\n[Matthew 28:18] All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\n[Matthew 28:19] Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:\n[Matthew 28:20] Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\n[Matthew 28:20] Amen.\n[Mark 1:15] The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.\n[Mark 1:17] Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.\n[Mark 1:25] Hold thy peace, and come out of him.\n[Mark 1:38] Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.\n[Mark 1:41] I will; be thou clean.\n[Mark 1:44] See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\n[Mark 2:5] Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.\n[Mark 2:8] Why reason ye these things in your hearts?\n[Mark 2:9] Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?\n[Mark 2:10] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins\n[Mark 2:11] I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.\n[Mark 2:14] Follow me.\n[Mark 2:17] They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\n[Mark 2:19] Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?\n[Mark 2:19] as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.\n[Mark 2:20] But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.\n[Mark 2:21] No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.\n[Mark 2:22] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.\n[Mark 2:25] Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?\n[Mark 2:26] How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?\n[Mark 2:27] The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:\n[Mark 2:28] Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.\n[Mark 3:3] Stand forth.\n[Mark 3:4] Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil?\n[Mark 3:4] to save life, or to kill?\n[Mark 3:5] Stretch forth thine hand.\n[Mark 3:23] How can Satan cast out Satan?\n[Mark 3:24] And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.\n[Mark 3:25] And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.\n[Mark 3:26] And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.\n[Mark 3:27] No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.\n[Mark 3:28] Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:\n[Mark 3:29] But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.\n[Mark 3:33] Who is my mother, or my brethren?\n[Mark 3:34] Behold my mother and my brethren!\n[Mark 3:35] For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.\n[Mark 4:3] Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:\n[Mark 4:4] And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.\n[Mark 4:5] And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:\n[Mark 4:6] But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.\n[Mark 4:7] And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.\n[Mark 4:8] And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.\n[Mark 4:9] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Mark 4:11] Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:\n[Mark 4:12] That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.\n[Mark 4:13] Know ye not this parable?\n[Mark 4:13] and how then will ye know all parables?\n[Mark 4:14] The sower soweth the word.\n[Mark 4:15] And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.\n[Mark 4:16] And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;\n[Mark 4:17] And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.\n[Mark 4:18] And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,\n[Mark 4:19] And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.\n[Mark 4:20] And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.\n[Mark 4:21] Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed?\n[Mark 4:21] and not to be set on a candlestick?\n[Mark 4:22] For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.\n[Mark 4:23] If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.", "chunk_size": 8164, "chunk_index": 4, "cut_type":

night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.\n[Mark 4:28] For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\n[Mark 4:29] But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.\n[Mark 4:30] Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?\n[Mark 4:30] or with what comparison shall we compare it?\n[Mark 4:31] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:\n[Mark 4:32] But when it is

desert place, and rest a while.\n[Mark 6:37] Give ye them to eat.\n[Mark 6:38] How many loaves have ye?\n[Mark 6:38] go and see.\n[Mark 6:50] Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.\n[Mark 7:6] Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.\n[Mark 7:7] Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\n[Mark 7:8] For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.\n[Mark 7:9] And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.\n[Mark 7:10] For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:\n[Mark 7:11] But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.\n[Mark 7:12] And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;\n[Mark 7:13] Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.\n[Mark 7:14] Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:\n[Mark 7:15] There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.\n[Mark 7:16] If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Mark 7:18] Are ye so without understanding also?\n[Mark 7:18] Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;\n[Mark 7:19] Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?\n[Mark 7:20] That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.\n[Mark 7:21] For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,\n[Mark 7:22] Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:\n[Mark 7:23] All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.\n[Mark 7:27] Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.\n[Mark 7:29] For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.\n[Mark 7:34] Be opened.\n[Mark 8:2] I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:\n[Mark 8:3] And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.\n[Mark 8:5] How many loaves have ye?\n[Mark 8:12] Why doth this generation seek after a sign?\n[Mark 8:12] verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.\n[Mark 8:15] Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.\n[Mark 8:17] Why reason ye, because ye have no bread?\n[Mark 8:17] perceive ye not yet, neither understand?\n[Mark 8:17] have ye your heart yet hardened?\n[Mark 8:18] Having eyes, see ye not?\n[Mark 8:18] and having ears, hear ye not?\n[Mark 8:18] and do ye not remember?\n[Mark 8:19] When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?\n[Mark 8:20] And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?\n[Mark 8:21] How is it that ye do not understand?\n[Mark 8:26] Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.\n[Mark 8:27] Whom do men say that I am?\n[Mark 8:29] But whom say ye that I am?\n[Mark 8:33] Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.\n[Mark 8:34] Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\n[Mark 8:35] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.\n[Mark 8:36] For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n[Mark 8:37] Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?\n[Mark 8:38] Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\n[Mark 9:1] Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.\n[Mark 9:12] Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.\n[Mark 9:13] But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.\n[Mark 9:16] What question ye with them?\n[Mark 9:19] O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you?\n[Mark 9:19] how long shall I suffer you?\n[Mark 9:19] bring him unto me.\n[Mark 9:21] How long is it ago since this came unto him?\n[Mark 9:23] If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\n[Mark 9:25] Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.\n[Mark 9:29] This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.\n[Mark 9:31] The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.\n[Mark 9:33] What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?\n[Mark 9:35] If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.\n[Mark 9:37] Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.\n[Mark 9:39] Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.\n[Mark 9:40] For he that is not against us is on our part.\n[Mark 9:41] For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.\n[Mark 9:42] And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.\n[Mark 9:43] And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:\n[Mark 9:44] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.\n[Mark 9:45] And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:\n[Mark 9:46] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.\n[Mark 9:47] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:\n[Mark 9:48] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.\n[Mark 9:49] For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.\n[Mark 9:50] Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it?\n[Mark 9:50] Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.\n[Mark 10:3] What did Moses command you?\n[Mark 10:5] For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.\n[Mark 10:6] But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.\n[Mark 10:7] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;\n[Mark 10:8] And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\n[Mark 10:9] What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\n[Mark 10:11] Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.\n[Mark 10:12] And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.\n[Mark 10:14] Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\n[Mark 10:15] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.\n[Mark 10:18] Why callest thou me good?\n[Mark 10:18] there is none good but one, that is, God.\n[Mark 10:19] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.\n[Mark 10:21] One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.\n[Mark 10:23] How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n[Mark 10:24] Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!\n[Mark 10:25] It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n[Mark 10:27] With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.\n[Mark 10:29] Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,\n[Mark 10:30] But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.\n[Mark 10:31] But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.\n[Mark 10:33] Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:\n[Mark 10:34] And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.\n[Mark 10:36] What would ye that I should do for you?\n[Mark 10:38] But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of?\n[Mark 10:38] and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?\n[Mark 10:39] Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:\n[Mark 10:40] But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.\n[Mark 10:42] Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.\n[Mark 10:43] But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:\n[Mark 10:44] And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.\n[Mark 10:45] For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\n[Mark 10:51] What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?\n[Mark 10:52] Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.\n[Mark 11:2] Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.\n[Mark 11:3] And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this?\n[Mark 11:3] say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.\n[Mark 11:14] No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever.\n[Mark 11:17] Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer?\n[Mark 11:17] but ye have made it a den of thieves.\n[Mark 11:22] Have faith in God.\n[Mark 11:23] For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.\n[Mark 11:24] Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\n[Mark 11:25] And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\n[Mark 11:26] But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.\n[Mark 11:29] I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.\n[Mark 11:30] The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?\n[Mark 11:30] answer me.\n[Mark 11:33] Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.\n[Mark 12:1] A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.\n[Mark 12:2] And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.\n[Mark 12:3] And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.\n[Mark 12:4] And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.\n[Mark 12:5] And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.\n[Mark 12:6] Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.\n[Mark 12:7] But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.\n[Mark 12:8] And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.\n[Mark 12:9] What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do?\n[Mark 12:9] he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.\n[Mark 12:10] And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:\n[Mark 12:11] This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?\n[Mark 12:15] Why tempt ye me?\n[Mark 12:15] bring me a penny, that I may see it.\n[Mark 12:16] Whose is this image and superscription?\n[Mark 12:17] Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.\n[Mark 12:24] Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?\n[Mark 12:25] For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.\n[Mark 12:26] And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\n[Mark 12:27] He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.", "chunk_size": 8170, "chunk_index": 5, "cut_type": "paragraph_end", "id": "b87cee74-0748-5765-a710-1675009cf348",

"\n[Mark 12:29] The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:\n[Mark 12:30] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.\n[Mark 12:31] And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\n[Mark 12:31] There is none other commandment greater than these.\n[Mark 12:34] Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.\n[Mark 12:35] How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?\n[Mark 12:36] For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.\n[Mark 12:37] David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son?\n[Mark 12:38] Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,\n[Mark 12:39] And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:\n[Mark 12:40] Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.\n[Mark 12:43] Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:\n[Mark 12:44] For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.\n[Mark 13:2] Seest thou these great buildings?\n[Mark 13:2] there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.\n[Mark 13:5] Take heed lest any man deceive you:\n[Mark 13:6] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\n[Mark 13:7] And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.\n[Mark 13:8] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.\n[Mark 13:9] But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.\n[Mark 13:10] And the gospel must first be published among all nations.\n[Mark 13:11] But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.\n[Mark 13:12] Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.\n[Mark 13:13] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.\n[Mark 13:14] But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:\n[Mark 13:15] And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:\n[Mark 13:16] And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.\n[Mark 13:17] But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!\n[Mark 13:18] And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.\n[Mark 13:19] For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.\n[Mark 13:20] And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.\n[Mark 13:21] And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:\n[Mark 13:22] For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.\n[Mark 13:23] But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.\n[Mark 13:24] But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,\n[Mark 13:25] And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.\n[Mark 13:26] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.\n[Mark 13:27] And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.\n[Mark 13:28] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:\n[Mark 13:29] So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.\n[Mark 13:30] Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.\n[Mark 13:31] Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.\n[Mark 13:32] But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.\n[Mark 13:33] Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.\n[Mark 13:34] For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.\n[Mark 13:35] Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:\n[Mark 13:36] Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.\n[Mark 13:37] And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.\n[Mark 14:6] Let her alone; why trouble ye her?\n[Mark 14:6] she hath wrought a good work on me.\n[Mark 14:7] For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.\n[Mark 14:8] She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.\n[Mark 14:9] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.\n[Mark 14:13] Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.\n[Mark 14:14] And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?\n[Mark 14:15] And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.\n[Mark 14:18] Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.\n[Mark 14:20] It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.\n[Mark 14:21] The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!\n[Mark 14:21] good were it for that man if he had never been born.\n[Mark 14:22] Take, eat: this is my body.\n[Mark 14:24] And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.\n[Mark 14:25] Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\n[Mark 14:27] All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.\n[Mark 14:28] But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.\n[Mark 14:30] Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\n[Mark 14:32] Sit ye here, while I shall pray.\n[Mark 14:34] My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.\n[Mark 14:36] Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.\n[Mark 14:37] Simon, sleepest thou?\n[Mark 14:37] couldest not thou watch one hour?\n[Mark 14:38] Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.\n[Mark 14:38] The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.\n[Mark 14:41] Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n[Mark 14:42] Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.\n[Mark 14:48] Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?\n[Mark 14:49] I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.\n[Mark 14:62] I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.\n[Mark 14:72] Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\n[Mark 15:2] Thou sayest it.\n[Mark 15:34] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\n[Mark 16:15] Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\n[Mark 16:16] He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\n[Mark 16:17] And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\n[Mark 16:18] They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n[Luke 2:49] How is it that ye sought me?\n[Luke 2:49] wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?\n[Luke 4:4] It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\n[Luke 4:8] Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.\n[Luke 4:12] It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\n[Luke 4:18] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,\n[Luke 4:19] To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\n[Luke 4:21] This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\n[Luke 4:23] Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.\n[Luke 4:24] Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.\n[Luke 4:25] But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;\n[Luke 4:26] But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.\n[Luke 4:27] And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.\n[Luke 4:35] Hold thy peace, and come out of him.\n[Luke 4:43] I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.\n[Luke 5:4] Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.\n[Luke 5:10] Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.\n[Luke 5:13] I will: be thou clean.\n[Luke 5:14] but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.\n[Luke 5:20] Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.\n[Luke 5:22] What reason ye in your hearts?\n[Luke 5:23] Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?\n[Luke 5:24] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.\n[Luke 5:27] Follow me.\n[Luke 5:31] They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.\n[Luke 5:32] I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\n[Luke 5:34] Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?\n[Luke 5:35] But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.\n[Luke 5:36] No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.\n[Luke 5:37] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.\n[Luke 5:38] But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.\n[Luke 5:39] No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.\n[Luke 6:3] Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;\n[Luke 6:4] How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?\n[Luke 6:5] That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.\n[Luke 6:8] Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.\n[Luke 6:9] I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil?\n[Luke 6:9] to save life, or to destroy it?\n[Luke 6:10] Stretch forth thy hand.\n[Luke 6:20] Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 6:21] Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.\n[Luke 6:21] Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.\n[Luke 6:22] Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\n[Luke 6:23] Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.\n[Luke 6:24] But woe unto you that are rich!\n[Luke 6:24] for ye have received your consolation.\n[Luke 6:25] Woe unto you that are full!\n[Luke 6:25] for ye shall hunger.\n[Luke 6:25] Woe unto you that laugh now!\n[Luke 6:25] for ye shall mourn and weep.\n[Luke 6:26] Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!\n[Luke 6:26] for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\n[Luke 6:27] But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,\n[Luke 6:28] Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you.\n[Luke 6:29] And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.\n[Luke 6:30] Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.\n[Luke 6:31] And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\n[Luke 6:32] For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye?\n[Luke 6:32] for sinners also love those that love them.\n[Luke 6:33] And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?\n[Luke 6:33] for sinners also do even the same.\n[Luke 6:34] And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye?\n[Luke 6:34] for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.\n[Luke 6:35] But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\n[Luke 6:36] Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.\n[Luke 6:37] Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:\n[Luke 6:38] Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.\n[Luke 6:38] For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.\n[Luke 6:39] Can the blind lead the blind?\n[Luke 6:39] shall they not both fall into the ditch?\n[Luke 6:40] The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.\n[Luke 6:41] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n[Luke 6:42] Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n[Luke 6:42] Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.\n[Luke 6:43] For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.\n[Luke 6:44] For every tree is known by his own fruit.\n[Luke 6:44] For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.\n[Luke 6:45] A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.\n[Luke 6:46] And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?", "chunk_size": 8069,

"\n[Luke 6:47] Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:\n[Luke 6:48] He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.\n[Luke 6:49] But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.\n[Luke 7:9] I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\n[Luke 7:13] Weep not.\n[Luke 7:14] Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.\n[Luke 7:22] Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.\n[Luke 7:23] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.\n[Luke 7:24] What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?\n[Luke 7:24] A reed shaken with the wind?\n[Luke 7:25] But what went ye out for to see?\n[Luke 7:25] A man clothed in soft raiment?\n[Luke 7:25] Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.\n[Luke 7:26] But what went ye out for to see?\n[Luke 7:26] A prophet?\n[Luke 7:26] Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.\n[Luke 7:27] This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\n[Luke 7:28] For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\n[Luke 7:31] Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation?\n[Luke 7:31] and to what are they like?\n[Luke 7:32] They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.\n[Luke 7:33] For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.\n[Luke 7:34] The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!\n[Luke 7:35] But wisdom is justified of all her children.\n[Luke 7:40] Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.\n[Luke 7:41] There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.\n[Luke 7:42] And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.\n[Luke 7:42] Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?\n[Luke 7:43] Thou hast rightly judged.\n[Luke 7:44] Seest thou this woman?\n[Luke 7:44] I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.\n[Luke 7:45] Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.\n[Luke 7:46] My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.\n[Luke 7:47] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.\n[Luke 7:48] Thy sins are forgiven.\n[Luke 7:50] Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.\n[Luke 8:5] A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.\n[Luke 8:6] And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.\n[Luke 8:7] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.\n[Luke 8:8] And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.\n[Luke 8:8] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Luke 8:10] Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.\n[Luke 8:11] Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.\n[Luke 8:12] Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.\n[Luke 8:13] They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.\n[Luke 8:14] And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.\n[Luke 8:15] But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.\n[Luke 8:16] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.\n[Luke 8:17] For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.\n[Luke 8:18] Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.\n[Luke 8:21] My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.\n[Luke 8:22] Let us go over unto the other side of the lake.\n[Luke 8:22] And they launched forth.\n[Luke 8:25] Where is your faith?\n[Luke 8:30] What is thy name?\n[Luke 8:39] Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee.\n[Luke 8:45] Who touched me?\n[Luke 8:46] Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\n[Luke 8:48] Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.\n[Luke 8:50] Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.\n[Luke 8:52] Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.\n[Luke 8:54] Maid, arise.\n[Luke 9:3] Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.\n[Luke 9:4] And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.\n[Luke 9:5] And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.\n[Luke 9:13] Give ye them to eat.\n[Luke 9:14] Make them sit down by fifties in a company.\n[Luke 9:18] Whom say the people that I am?\n[Luke 9:20] But whom say ye that I am?\n[Luke 9:22] The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.\n[Luke 9:23] If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.\n[Luke 9:24] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\n[Luke 9:25] For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?\n[Luke 9:26] For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.\n[Luke 9:27] But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 9:41] O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you?\n[Luke 9:41] Bring thy son hither.\n[Luke 9:44] Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.\n[Luke 9:48] Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.\n[Luke 9:50] Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.\n[Luke 9:55] Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.\n[Luke 9:56] For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.\n[Luke 9:58] Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.\n[Luke 9:59] Follow me.\n[Luke 9:60] Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 9:62] No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 10:2] The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.\n[Luke 10:3] Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.\n[Luke 10:4] Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.\n[Luke 10:5] And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.\n[Luke 10:6] And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.\n[Luke 10:7] And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire.\n[Luke 10:7] Go not from house to house.\n[Luke 10:8] And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:\n[Luke 10:9] And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\n[Luke 10:10] But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,\n[Luke 10:11] Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\n[Luke 10:12] But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.\n[Luke 10:13] Woe unto thee, Chorazin!\n[Luke 10:13] woe unto thee, Bethsaida!\n[Luke 10:13] for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.\n[Luke 10:14] But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.\n[Luke 10:15] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.\n[Luke 10:16] He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.\n[Luke 10:18] I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.\n[Luke 10:19] Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\n[Luke 10:20] Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.\n[Luke 10:21] I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.\n[Luke 10:22] All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.\n[Luke 10:23] Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:\n[Luke 10:24] For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.\n[Luke 10:26] What is written in the law?\n[Luke 10:26] how readest thou?\n[Luke 10:28] Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.\n[Luke 10:30] A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.\n[Luke 10:31] And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.\n[Luke 10:32] And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.\n[Luke 10:33] But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,\n[Luke 10:34] And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.\n[Luke 10:35] And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\n[Luke 10:36] Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?\n[Luke 10:37] Go, and do thou likewise.\n[Luke 10:41] Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:\n[Luke 10:42] But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.\n[Luke 11:2] When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\n[Luke 11:2] Thy kingdom come.\n[Luke 11:2] Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.\n[Luke 11:3] Give us day by day our daily bread.\n[Luke 11:4] And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.\n[Luke 11:4] And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.\n[Luke 11:5] Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;\n[Luke 11:6] For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?\n[Luke 11:7] And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.\n[Luke 11:8] I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.\n[Luke 11:9] And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\n[Luke 11:10] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\n[Luke 11:11] If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?\n[Luke 11:11] or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?\n[Luke 11:12] Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?\n[Luke 11:13] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\n[Luke 11:17] Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.\n[Luke 11:18] If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?\n[Luke 11:18] because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.\n[Luke 11:19] And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?\n[Luke 11:19] therefore shall they be your judges.\n[Luke 11:20] But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.\n[Luke 11:21] When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:\n[Luke 11:22] But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.\n[Luke 11:23] He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.\n[Luke 11:24] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.\n[Luke 11:25] And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.\n[Luke 11:26] Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.\n[Luke 11:28] Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.\n[Luke 11:29] This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.\n[Luke 11:30] For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.\n[Luke 11:31] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.\n[Luke 11:32] The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.\n[Luke 11:33] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.\n[Luke 11:34] The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.\n[Luke 11:35] Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.", "chunk_size": 8116, "chunk_index":

having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.\n[Luke 11:39] Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.\n[Luke 11:40] Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?\n[Luke 11:41] But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.\n[Luke 11:42] But woe unto you, Pharisees!\n[Luke 11:42] for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.\n[Luke 11:43] Woe unto you, Pharisees!\n[Luke 11:43] for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.\n[Luke 11:44] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\n[Luke 11:44] for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.\n[Luke 11:46] Woe unto you also, ye lawyers!\n[Luke 11:46] for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.\n[Luke 11:47] Woe unto you!\n[Luke 11:47] for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.\n[Luke 11:48] Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.\n[Luke 11:49] Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:\n[Luke 11:50] That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;\n[Luke 11:51] From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.\n[Luke 11:52] Woe unto you, lawyers!\n[Luke 11:52] for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.\n[Luke 12:1] Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.\n[Luke 12:2] For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.\n[Luke 12:3] Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.\n[Luke 12:4] And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.\n[Luke 12:5] But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.\n[Luke 12:6] Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?\n[Luke 12:7] But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\n[Luke 12:7] Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.\n[Luke 12:8] Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:\n[Luke 12:9] But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.\n[Luke 12:10] And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.\n[Luke 12:11] And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:\n[Luke 12:12] For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.\n[Luke 12:14] Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?\n[Luke 12:15] Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\n[Luke 12:16] And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:\n[Luke 12:17] And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?\n[Luke 12:18] This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.\n[Luke 12:19] And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\n[Luke 12:20] But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?\n[Luke 12:21] So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.\n[Luke 12:22] Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.\n[Luke 12:23] The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.\n[Luke 12:24] Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?\n[Luke 12:25] And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?\n[Luke 12:26] If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?\n[Luke 12:27] Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n[Luke 12:28] If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?\n[Luke 12:29] And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.\n[Luke 12:30] For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.\n[Luke 12:31] But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.\n[Luke 12:32] Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.\n[Luke 12:33] Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\n[Luke 12:34] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n[Luke 12:35] Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;\n[Luke 12:36] And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.\n[Luke 12:37] Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.\n[Luke 12:38] And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.\n[Luke 12:39] And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.\n[Luke 12:40] Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.\n[Luke 12:42] Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?\n[Luke 12:43] Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.\n[Luke 12:44] Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.\n[Luke 12:45] But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;\n[Luke 12:46] The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.\n[Luke 12:47] And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.\n[Luke 12:48] But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.\n[Luke 12:48] For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.\n[Luke 12:49] I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?\n[Luke 12:50] But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!\n[Luke 12:51] Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?\n[Luke 12:51] I tell you, Nay; but rather division:\n[Luke 12:52] For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.\n[Luke 12:53] The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n[Luke 12:54] When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.\n[Luke 12:55] And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.\n[Luke 12:56] Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?\n[Luke 12:57] Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?\n[Luke 12:58] When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.\n[Luke 12:59] I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite.\n[Luke 13:2] Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?\n[Luke 13:3] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\n[Luke 13:4] Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?\n[Luke 13:5] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\n[Luke 13:6] A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n[Luke 13:7] Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\n[Luke 13:8] And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:\n[Luke 13:9] And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.\n[Luke 13:12] Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.\n[Luke 13:15] The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?\n[Luke 13:16] And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?\n[Luke 13:18] Unto what is the kingdom of God like?\n[Luke 13:18] and whereunto shall I resemble it?\n[Luke 13:19] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.\n[Luke 13:20] Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?\n[Luke 13:21] It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.\n[Luke 13:24] Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\n[Luke 13:25] When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:\n[Luke 13:26] Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.\n[Luke 13:27] But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.\n[Luke 13:28] There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.\n[Luke 13:29] And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 13:30] And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.\n[Luke 13:32] Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.\n[Luke 13:33] Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.\n[Luke 13:34] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!\n[Luke 13:35] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\n[Luke 14:3] Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?\n[Luke 14:5] Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?\n[Luke 14:8] When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;\n[Luke 14:9] And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.\n[Luke 14:10] But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.\n[Luke 14:11] For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\n[Luke 14:12] When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.\n[Luke 14:13] But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:\n[Luke 14:14] And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\n[Luke 14:16] A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:\n[Luke 14:17] And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.\n[Luke 14:18] And they all with one consent began to make excuse.\n[Luke 14:18] The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.\n[Luke 14:19] And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.\n[Luke 14:20] And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.\n[Luke 14:21] So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things.\n[Luke 14:21] Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.\n[Luke 14:22] And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.\n[Luke 14:23] And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.\n[Luke 14:24] For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.\n[Luke 14:26] If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.\n[Luke 14:27] And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.\n[Luke 14:28] For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?\n[Luke 14:29] Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,\n[Luke 14:30] Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.\n[Luke 14:31] Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?\n[Luke 14:32] Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.\n[Luke 14:33] So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\n[Luke 14:34] Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?\n[Luke 14:35] It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out.\n[Luke 14:35] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n[Luke 15:4] What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?", "chunk_size": 8171, "chunk_index": 8, "cut_type": "paragraph_end", "id": "11714f64-89b5-5d97-af97-1be5333059b9", "color":

together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.\n[Luke 15:7] I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.\n[Luke 15:8] Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?\n[Luke 15:9] And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.\n[Luke 15:10] Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.\n[Luke 15:11] A certain man had two sons:\n[Luke 15:12] And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.\n[Luke 15:12] And he divided unto them his living.\n[Luke 15:13] And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.\n[Luke 15:14] And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.\n[Luke 15:15] And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.\n[Luke 15:16] And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.\n[Luke 15:17] And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!\n[Luke 15:18] I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,\n[Luke 15:19] And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\n[Luke 15:20] And he arose, and came to his father.\n[Luke 15:20] But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\n[Luke 15:21] And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\n[Luke 15:22] But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:\n[Luke 15:23] And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:\n[Luke 15:24] For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.\n[Luke 15:24] And they began to be merry.\n[Luke 15:25] Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.\n[Luke 15:26] And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.\n[Luke 15:27] And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.\n[Luke 15:28] And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.\n[Luke 15:29] And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:\n[Luke 15:30] But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\n[Luke 15:31] And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.\n[Luke 15:32] It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\n[Luke 16:1] There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.\n[Luke 16:2] And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee?\n[Luke 16:2] give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.\n[Luke 16:3] Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do?\n[Luke 16:3] for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.\n[Luke 16:4] I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.\n[Luke 16:5] So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?\n[Luke 16:6] And he said, An hundred measures of oil.\n[Luke 16:6] And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.\n[Luke 16:7] Then said he to another, And how much owest thou?\n[Luke 16:7] And he said, An hundred measures of wheat.\n[Luke 16:7] And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.\n[Luke 16:8] And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.\n[Luke 16:9] And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.\n[Luke 16:10] He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\n[Luke 16:11] If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?\n[Luke 16:12] And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?\n[Luke 16:13] No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.\n[Luke 16:13] Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n[Luke 16:15] Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.\n[Luke 16:16] The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.\n[Luke 16:17] And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.\n[Luke 16:18] Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.\n[Luke 16:19] There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:\n[Luke 16:20] And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,\n[Luke 16:21] And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.\n[Luke 16:22] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;\n[Luke 16:23] And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.\n[Luke 16:24] And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\n[Luke 16:25] But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.\n[Luke 16:26] And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.\n[Luke 16:27] Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:\n[Luke 16:28] For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.\n[Luke 16:29] Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.\n[Luke 16:30] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.\n[Luke 16:31] And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\n[Luke 17:1] It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!\n[Luke 17:2] It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.\n[Luke 17:3] Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.\n[Luke 17:4] And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.\n[Luke 17:6] If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.\n[Luke 17:7] But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?\n[Luke 17:8] And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?\n[Luke 17:9] Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him?\n[Luke 17:9] I trow not.\n[Luke 17:10] So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.\n[Luke 17:14] Go shew yourselves unto the priests.\n[Luke 17:17] Were there not ten cleansed?\n[Luke 17:17] but where are the nine?\n[Luke 17:18] There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.\n[Luke 17:19] Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.\n[Luke 17:20] The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:\n[Luke 17:21] Neither shall they say, Lo here!\n[Luke 17:21] or, lo there!\n[Luke 17:21] for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\n[Luke 17:22] The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.\n[Luke 17:23] And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.\n[Luke 17:24] For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.\n[Luke 17:25] But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.\n[Luke 17:26] And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.\n[Luke 17:27] They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.\n[Luke 17:28] Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;\n[Luke 17:29] But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.\n[Luke 17:30] Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.\n[Luke 17:31] In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.\n[Luke 17:32] Remember Lot's wife.\n[Luke 17:33] Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.\n[Luke 17:34] I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.\n[Luke 17:35] Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.\n[Luke 17:36] Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.\n[Luke 17:37] Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.\n[Luke 18:2] There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:\n[Luke 18:3] And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.\n[Luke 18:4] And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;\n[Luke 18:5] Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.\n[Luke 18:6] Hear what the unjust judge saith.\n[Luke 18:7] And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?\n[Luke 18:8] I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.\n[Luke 18:8] Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\n[Luke 18:10] Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.\n[Luke 18:11] The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.\n[Luke 18:12] I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\n[Luke 18:13] And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.\n[Luke 18:14] I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\n[Luke 18:16] Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 18:17] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.\n[Luke 18:19] Why callest thou me good?\n[Luke 18:19] none is good, save one, that is, God.\n[Luke 18:20] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.\n[Luke 18:22] Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.\n[Luke 18:24] How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!\n[Luke 18:25] For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\n[Luke 18:27] The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.\n[Luke 18:29] Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,\n[Luke 18:30] Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.\n[Luke 18:31] Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.\n[Luke 18:32] For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:\n[Luke 18:33] And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.\n[Luke 18:41] What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?\n[Luke 18:42] Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.\n[Luke 19:5] Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.\n[Luke 19:9] This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.\n[Luke 19:10] For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\n[Luke 19:12] A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.\n[Luke 19:13] And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.\n[Luke 19:14] But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.\n[Luke 19:15] And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.\n[Luke 19:16] Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.\n[Luke 19:17] And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.\n[Luke 19:18] And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.\n[Luke 19:19] And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.\n[Luke 19:20] And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:\n[Luke 19:21] For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.\n[Luke 19:22] And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant.\n[Luke 19:22] Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:\n[Luke 19:23] Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?\n[Luke 19:24] And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.\n[Luke 19:25] (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)\n[Luke 19:26] For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.", "chunk_size": 8145, "chunk_index": 9, "cut_type": "paragraph_end", "id": "6adb521a-82c7-5ef9-aa0d-ed9ded6b437d",

but that the world through him might be saved.\n[John 3:18] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n[John 3:19] And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.\n[John 3:20] For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\n[John 3:21] But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.\n[John 4:7] Give me to drink.\n[John 4:10] If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink;

thy son liveth.\n[John 4:53] Thy son liveth:\n[John 5:6] Wilt thou be made whole?\n[John 5:8] Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\n[John 5:14] Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\n[John 5:17] My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\n[John 5:19] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\n[John 5:20] For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.\n[John 5:21] For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.\n[John 5:22] For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:\n[John 5:23] That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.\n[John 5:23] He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.\n[John 5:24] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.\n[John 5:25] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.\n[John 5:26] For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;\n[John 5:27] And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.\n[John 5:28] Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,\n[John 5:29] And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\n[John 5:30] I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\n[John 5:31] If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.\n[John 5:32] There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.\n[John 5:33] Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.\n[John 5:34] But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.\n[John 5:35] He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.\n[John 5:36] But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.\n[John 5:37] And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.\n[John 5:37] Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.\n[John 5:38] And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.\n[John 5:39] Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.\n[John 5:40] And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.\n[John 5:41] I receive not honour from men.\n[John 5:42] But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.\n[John 5:43] I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\n[John 5:44] How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?\n[John 5:45] Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.\n[John 5:46] For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.\n[John 5:47] But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?\n[John 6:5] Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\n[John 6:10] Make the men sit down.\n[John 6:12] Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.\n[John 6:20] It is I; be not afraid.\n[John 6:26] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.\n[John 6:27] Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.\n[John 6:29] This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.\n[John 6:32] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.\n[John 6:33] For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.\n[John 6:35] I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.\n[John 6:36] But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.\n[John 6:37] All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.\n[John 6:38] For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.\n[John 6:39] And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\n[John 6:40] And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\n[John 6:43] Murmur not among yourselves.\n[John 6:44] No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.\n[John 6:45] It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.\n[John 6:45] Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.\n[John 6:46] Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.\n[John 6:47] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.\n[John 6:48] I am that bread of life.\n[John 6:49] Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.\n[John 6:50] This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.\n[John 6:51] I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\n[John 6:53] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.\n[John 6:54] Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\n[John 6:55] For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.\n[John 6:56] He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.\n[John 6:57] As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.\n[John 6:58] This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.\n[John 6:61] Doth this offend you?\n[John 6:62] What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?\n[John 6:63] It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\n[John 6:64] But there are some of you that believe not.\n[John 6:65] Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.\n[John 6:67] Will ye also go away?\n[John 6:70] Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?\n[John 7:6] My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.\n[John 7:7] The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.\n[John 7:8] Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.\n[John 7:16] My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\n[John 7:17] If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.\n[John 7:18] He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.\n[John 7:19] Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?\n[John 7:19] Why go ye about to kill me?\n[John 7:21] I have done one work, and ye all marvel.\n[John 7:22] Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.\n[John 7:23] If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?\n[John 7:24] Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\n[John 7:28] Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.\n[John 7:29] But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.\n[John 7:33] Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.\n[John 7:34] Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.\n[John 7:37] If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.\n[John 7:38] He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\n[John 8:7] He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\n[John 8:10] Woman, where are those thine accusers?\n[John 8:10] hath no man condemned thee?\n[John 8:11] Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\n[John 8:12] I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\n[John 8:14] Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.\n[John 8:15] Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.\n[John 8:16] And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.\n[John 8:17] It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.\n[John 8:18] I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.\n[John 8:19] Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.\n[John 8:21] I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.\n[John 8:23] Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.\n[John 8:24] I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.\n[John 8:25] Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.\n[John 8:26] I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.\n[John 8:28] When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.\n[John 8:29] And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.\n[John 8:31] If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;\n[John 8:32] And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\n[John 8:34] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.\n[John 8:35] And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.\n[John 8:36] If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.\n[John 8:37] I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.\n[John 8:38] I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.\n[John 8:39] If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.\n[John 8:40] But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.\n[John 8:41] Ye do the deeds of your father.\n[John 8:42] If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.\n[John 8:43] Why do ye not understand my speech?\n[John 8:43] even because ye cannot hear my word.\n[John 8:44] Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.\n[John 8:44] He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.\n[John 8:44] When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.\n[John 8:45] And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.\n[John 8:46] Which of you convinceth me of sin?\n[John 8:46] And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?\n[John 8:47] He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.\n[John 8:49] I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.\n[John 8:50] And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\n[John 8:51] Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.\n[John 8:54] If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:\n[John 8:55] Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.\n[John 8:56] Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.\n[John 8:58] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.\n[John 9:3] Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\n[John 9:4] I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.\n[John 9:5] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\n[John 9:7] Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.\n[John 9:35] Dost thou believe on the Son of God?\n[John 9:37] Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.\n[John 9:39] For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.\n[John 9:41] If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.\n[John 10:1] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\n[John 10:2] But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.\n[John 10:3] To him the porter openeth;

but thou shalt know hereafter.\n[John 13:8] If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.\n[John 13:10] He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.\n[John 13:11] Ye are not all clean.\n[John 13:12] Know ye what I have done to you?\n[John 13:13] Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.\n[John 13:14] If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.\n[John 13:15] For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\n[John 13:16] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.\n[John 13:17] If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.\n[John 13:18] I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.\n[John 13:19] Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.\n[John 13:20] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.\n[John 13:21] Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.\n[John 13:26] He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.\n[John 13:27] That thou doest, do quickly.\n[John 13:31] Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.\n[John 13:32] If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.\n[John 13:33] Little children, yet a little while I am with you.\n[John 13:33] Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.\n[John 13:34] A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.\n[John 13:35] By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\n[John 13:36] Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.\n[John 13:38] Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?\n[John 13:38] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.\n[John 14:1] Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.\n[John 14:2] In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.\n[John 14:2] I go to prepare a place for you.\n[John 14:3] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.\n[John 14:4] And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.\n[John 14:6] I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n[John 14:7] If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.\n[John 14:9] Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?\n[John 14:9] he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?\n[John 14:10] Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?\n[John 14:10] the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.\n[John 14:11] Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.\n[John 14:12] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\n[John 14:13] And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.\n[John 14:14] If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.\n[John 14:15] If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n[John 14:16] And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;\n[John 14:17] Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.\n[John 14:18] I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.\n[John 14:19] Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.\n[John 14:20] At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.\n[John 14:21] He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\n[John 14:23] If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\n[John 14:24] He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.\n[John 14:25] These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.\n[John 14:26] But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\n[John 14:27] Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.\n[John 14:27] Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\n[John 14:28] Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you.\n[John 14:28] If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.\n[John 14:29] And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.\n[John 14:30] Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.\n[John 14:31] But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.\n[John 14:31] Arise, let us go hence.\n[John 15:1] I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.\n[John 15:2] Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\n[John 15:3] Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.\n[John 15:4] Abide in me, and I in you.\n[John 15:4] As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.\n[John 15:5] I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.\n[John 15:6] If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.\n[John 15:7] If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.\n[John 15:8] Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.\n[John 15:9] As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.\n[John 15:10] If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\n[John 15:11] These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\n[John 15:12] This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.\n[John 15:13] Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\n[John 15:14] Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.\n[John 15:15] Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\n[John 15:16] Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n[John 15:17] These things I command you, that ye love one another.\n[John 15:18] If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.\n[John 15:19] If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\n[John 15:20] Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.\n[John 15:20] If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.\n[John 15:21] But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.\n[John 15:22] If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.\n[John 15:23] He that hateth me hateth my Father also.\n[John 15:24] If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.\n[John 15:25] But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.\n[John 15:26] But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:\n[John 15:27] And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.\n[John 16:1] These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.\n[John 16:2] They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.\n[John 16:3] And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.\n[John 16:4] But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.\n[John 16:4] And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.\n[John 16:5] But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?\n[John 16:6] But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.\n[John 16:7] Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.", "chunk_size": 8171, "chunk_index": 12, "cut_type": "paragraph_end", "id": "04789c7e-1eff-5d4b-9b52-c5672d7bbe58", "color": "#801212"}, {"name": "entity", "type": "EntityType", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "entity", "id": "ebc73211-3a89-507f-b7d5-23f73522e1b4", "color": "#6510f4"}, {"name": "comforter", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "A term used to refer to the Holy Spirit.", "id": "a0e5241c-6451-5401-93c4-00db7a629c49", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "sheep", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "Symbolic representation of followers of Jesus.", "id": "ff830674-3db3-542d-9785-5b003a8e0bd9", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "thief", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "Represents danger or evil that seeks to harm the sheep.", "id": "d22f5347-e171-5730-87f4-1b6a364f3a16", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "branch", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "Represents believers who are part of Jesus.", "id": "ad9dd386-60ea-5204-9bd7-0a4861b87c02", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "vine", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "Metaphor for Jesus, representing sustenance and life.", "id": "8a8b6c0e-76d2-57f6-9879-f0fc513ef09d", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "one_fold", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "Concept of unity among all followers of Jesus.", "id": "19b9eb2a-9e42-5e79-9f61-0bf7d6eda325", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "eternal_life", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "The life promised by Jesus to those who believe in him.", "id": "e8bb4e61-84c2-5e2a-bae0-a2614ee09fdd", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "love_commandment", "type": "Entity", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["name"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "description": "Commandment given by Jesus to love one another.", "id": "cc62e8ca-96ae-56b9-890d-f71e3620f893", "color": "#f47710"}, {"name": "", "type": "DocumentChunk", "ontology_valid": false, "version": 1, "topological_rank": 0, "metadata": {"index_fields": ["text"]}, "belongs_to_set": null, "text": "\n[John 16:8] And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:\n[John 16:9] Of sin, because they believe not on me;\n[John 16:10] Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;\n[John 16:11] Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.\n[John 16:12] I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\n[John 16:13] Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself;
