2023-10-03 11:42:29+00:00,Online Multimedia Verification with Computational Tools and OSINT: Russia-Ukraine Conflict Case Studies,"['Sohail Ahmed Khan', 'Jan Gunnar Furuly', 'Henrik Brattli Vold', 'Rano Tahseen', 'Duc-Tien Dang-Nguyen']","This paper investigates the use of computational tools and Open-Source
Intelligence (OSINT) techniques for verifying online multimedia content, with a
specific focus on real-world cases from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Over a
nine-month period from April to December 2022, we examine verification
workflows, tools, and case studies published by \faktiskbar. Our study
showcases the effectiveness of diverse resources, including AI tools,
geolocation tools, internet archives, and social media monitoring platforms, in
enabling journalists and fact-checkers to efficiently process and corroborate
evidence, ensuring the dissemination of accurate information. This research
underscores the vital role of computational tools and OSINT techniques in
promoting evidence-based reporting and combatting misinformation. We also touch
on the current limitations of available tools and prospects for future
developments in multimedia verification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01978v1,cs.MM
2023-09-06 19:03:49+00:00,C-CLIP: Contrastive Image-Text Encoders to Close the Descriptive-Commentative Gap,"['William Theisen', 'Walter Scheirer']","The interplay between the image and comment on a social media post is one of
high importance for understanding its overall message. Recent strides in
multimodal embedding models, namely CLIP, have provided an avenue forward in
relating image and text. However the current training regime for CLIP models is
insufficient for matching content found on social media, regardless of site or
language. Current CLIP training data is based on what we call ``descriptive''
text: text in which an image is merely described. This is something rarely seen
on social media, where the vast majority of text content is ``commentative'' in
nature. The captions provide commentary and broader context related to the
image, rather than describing what is in it. Current CLIP models perform poorly
on retrieval tasks where image-caption pairs display a commentative
relationship. Closing this gap would be beneficial for several important
application areas related to social media. For instance, it would allow groups
focused on Open-Source Intelligence Operations (OSINT) to further aid efforts
during disaster events, such as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, by
easily exposing data to non-technical users for discovery and analysis. In
order to close this gap we demonstrate that training contrastive image-text
encoders on explicitly commentative pairs results in large improvements in
retrieval results, with the results extending across a variety of non-English
languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03921v1,cs.CV

and internet usage affecting individuals worldwide. This paper proposes an
open-source intelligence pipeline using data from Twitter to track keywords
relevant to cyberbullying in social media to build dashboards for law
enforcement agents. We discuss the prevalence of cyberbullying on social media,
factors that compel individuals to indulge in cyberbullying, and the legal
implications of cyberbullying in different countries also highlight the lack of
direction, resources, training, and support that law enforcement officers face
in investigating cyberbullying cases. The proposed interventions for
cyberbullying involve collective efforts from various stakeholders, including
parents, law enforcement, social media platforms, educational institutions,
educators, and researchers. Our research provides a framework for cyberbullying
and provides a comprehensive view of the digital landscape for investigators to
track and identify cyberbullies, their tactics, and patterns. An OSINT
dashboard with real-time monitoring empowers law enforcement to swiftly take
action, protect victims, and make significant strides toward creating a safer
online environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15225v2,cs.CY
2023-06-09 18:18:58+00:00,The Use of Public Data and Free Tools in National CSIRTs' Operational Practices: A Systematic Literature Review,"['Sharifah Roziah Binti Mohd Kassim', 'Shujun Li', 'Budi Arief']","Many CSIRTs, including national CSIRTs, routinely use public data, including
open-source intelligence (OSINT) and free tools, which include open-source
tools in their work. However, we observed a lack of public information and
systematic discussions regarding how national CSIRTs use and perceive public
data and free tools in their operational practices. Therefore, this paper
provides a systematic literature review (SLR) to comprehensively understand how
national CSIRTs use and perceive public data and free tools in facilitating
incident responses in operations. Our SLR method followed a three-stage
approach: 1) a systematic search to identify relevant publications from
websites of pertinent CSIRT organisations, 2) a conventional SLR into the
research literature, and 3) synthesise data from stages one and two to answer
the research questions. In the first stage, we searched the websites of 100
national CSIRTs and 11 cross-CSIRT organisations to identify relevant
information about national CSIRTs. In the second stage, we searched a
scientific database (Scopus) to identify relevant research papers. Our primary
finding from the SLR is that most discussions concerning public data and free
tools by national CSIRTs are incomplete, ad hoc, or fragmented. We discovered a
lack of discussions on how the staff of national CSIRTs perceive the usefulness
of public data and free tools to facilitate incident responses. Such gaps can
prevent us from understanding how national CSIRTs can benefit from public data
and free tools and how other organisations, individuals and researchers can
help by providing such data and tools to improve national CSIRTs' operation.
These findings call for more empirical research on how national CSIRTs use and
perceive public data and free tools to improve the overall incident responses
at national CSIRTs and other incident response organisations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07988v1,cs.DL
2023-04-24 09:53:33+00:00,ThreatCrawl: A BERT-based Focused Crawler for the Cybersecurity Domain,"['Philipp Kuehn', 'Mike Schmidt', 'Markus Bayer', 'Christian Reuter']","Publicly available information contains valuable information for Cyber Threat
Intelligence (CTI). This can be used to prevent attacks that have already taken
place on other systems. Ideally, only the initial attack succeeds and all
subsequent ones are detected and stopped. But while there are different
standards to exchange this information, a lot of it is shared in articles or
blog posts in non-standardized ways. Manually scanning through multiple online
portals and news pages to discover new threats and extracting them is a
time-consuming task. To automize parts of this scanning process, multiple
papers propose extractors that use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from documents. However, while this already
solves the problem of extracting the information out of documents, the search
for these documents is rarely considered. In this paper, a new focused crawler
is proposed called ThreatCrawl, which uses Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based models to classify documents and
adapt its crawling path dynamically. While ThreatCrawl has difficulties to
classify the specific type of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) named in texts,
e.g., IOC content, it can successfully find relevant documents and modify its
path accordingly. It yields harvest rates of up to 52%, which are, to the best
of our knowledge, better than the current state of the art.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.11960v2,cs.CR

Threat Intelligence (CTI) that contains semi-structured data and/or text to
populate knowledge graphs. A potential risk is that fake CTI can be generated
and spread through Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) communities or on the Web
to effect a data poisoning attack on these systems. Adversaries can use fake
CTI examples as training input to subvert cyber defense systems, forcing the
model to learn incorrect inputs to serve their malicious needs.
  In this paper, we automatically generate fake CTI text descriptions using
transformers. We show that given an initial prompt sentence, a public language
model like GPT-2 with fine-tuning, can generate plausible CTI text with the
ability of corrupting cyber-defense systems. We utilize the generated fake CTI
text to perform a data poisoning attack on a Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph
(CKG) and a cybersecurity corpus. The poisoning attack introduced adverse
impacts such as returning incorrect reasoning outputs, representation
poisoning, and corruption of other dependent AI-based cyber defense systems. We
evaluate with traditional approaches and conduct a human evaluation study with
cybersecurity professionals and threat hunters. Based on the study,
professional threat hunters were equally likely to consider our fake generated
CTI as true.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04351v3,cs.CR

assist and perpetrate criminal behaviour. One of the most important ways in
which law enforcement can battle this growing trend is through accessing
pertinent information about suspects in a timely manner. A significant
hindrance to this is the difficulty of accessing any system a suspect uses that
requires authentication via password. Password guessing techniques generally
consider common user behaviour while generating their passwords, as well as the
password policy in place. Such techniques can offer a modest success rate
considering a large/average population. However, they tend to fail when
focusing on a single target -- especially when the latter is an educated user
taking precautions as a savvy criminal would be expected to do. Open Source
Intelligence is being increasingly leveraged by Law Enforcement in order to
gain useful information about a suspect, but very little is currently being
done to integrate this knowledge in an automated way within password cracking.
The purpose of this research is to delve into the techniques that enable the
gathering of the necessary context about a suspect and find ways to leverage
this information within password guessing techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01159v1,cs.CR

important application in intelligent profiling of individuals. With a variety
of tools available, significant data shall be obtained on an individual as a
consequence of analyzing his/her internet presence but all of this comes at the
cost of low relevance. To increase the relevance score in profiling,
PeopleXploit is being introduced. PeopleXploit is a hybrid tool which helps in
collecting the publicly available information that is reliable and relevant to
the given input. This tool is used to track and trace the given target with
their digital footprints like Name, Email, Phone Number, User IDs etc. and the
tool will scan & search other associated data from public available records
from the internet and create a summary report against the target. PeopleXploit
profiles a person using authorship analysis and finds the best matching guess.
Also, the type of analysis performed (professional/matrimonial/criminal entity)
varies with the requirement of the user.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15668v1,cs.CY

meaningfully triage videos and images of munitions, weapons, and military
equipment, even when limited training data exists for the object of interest.
This workflow is designed to expedite the work of OSINT (""open source
intelligence"") researchers in human rights investigations. It consists of three
components: automatic rendering and annotating of synthetic datasets that make
up for a lack of training data; training image classifiers from combined sets
of photographic and synthetic data; and mtriage, an open source software that
orchestrates these classifiers' deployment to triage public domain media, and
visualise predictions in a web interface. We show that synthetic data helps to
train classifiers more effectively, and that certain approaches yield better
results for different architectures. We then demonstrate our workflow in two
real-world human rights investigations: the use of the Triple-Chaser tear gas
grenade against civilians, and the verification of allegations of military
presence in Ukraine in 2014.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01030v1,cs.CV
2020-01-07 21:20:26+00:00,Is Cryptojacking Dead after Coinhive Shutdown?,"['Said Varlioglu', 'Bilal Gonen', 'Murat Ozer', 'Mehmet F. Bastug']","Cryptojacking is the exploitation of victims' computer resources to mine for
cryptocurrency using malicious scripts. It has become popular after 2017 when
attackers started to exploit legal mining scripts, especially Coinhive scripts.
Coinhive was actually a legal mining service that provided scripts and servers
for in-browser mining activities. Nevertheless, over 10 million web users had
been victims every month before the Coinhive shutdown that happened in Mar
2019. This paper explores the new era of the cryptojacking world after Coinhive
discontinued its service. We aimed to see whether and how attackers continue
cryptojacking, generate new malicious scripts, and developed new methods. We
used a capable cryptojacking detector named CMTracker that proposed by Hong et
al. in 2018. We automatically and manually examined 2770 websites that had been
detected by CMTracker before the Coinhive shutdown. The results revealed that
99\% of sites no longer continue cryptojacking. 1\% of websites still run 8
unique mining scripts. By tracking these mining scripts, we detected 632 unique
cryptojacking websites. Moreover, open-source investigations (OSINT)
demonstrated that attackers still use the same methods. Therefore, we listed
the typical patterns of cryptojacking. We concluded that cryptojacking is not
dead after the Coinhive shutdown. It is still alive, but not as attractive as
it used to be.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02975v3,cs.CR

the nature of social relationships. The increasing amount of personal
information that runs through this platform publicly exposes user behaviour and
social trends, allowing aggregation of data through conventional intelligence
collection techniques such as OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). In this paper,
we propose a new method to detect and diagnose variations in overall Facebook
user psychology through Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and machine learning
techniques. We are aggregating the spectrum of user sentiments and views by
using N-Games charts, which exhibit noticeable variations over time, validated
through long term collection. We postulate that the proposed approach can be
used by security organisations to understand and evaluate the user psychology,
then use the information to predict insider threats or prevent insider attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14417v1,cs.CR

2019-01-03 18:51:30+00:00,A First Look at the Crypto-Mining Malware Ecosystem: A Decade of Unrestricted Wealth,"['Sergio Pastrana', 'Guillermo Suarez-Tangil']","Illicit crypto-mining leverages resources stolen from victims to mine
cryptocurrencies on behalf of criminals. While recent works have analyzed one
side of this threat, i.e.: web-browser cryptojacking, only commercial reports
have partially covered binary-based crypto-mining malware. In this paper, we
conduct the largest measurement of crypto-mining malware to date, analyzing
approximately 4.5 million malware samples (1.2 million malicious miners), over
a period of twelve years from 2007 to 2019. Our analysis pipeline applies both
static and dynamic analysis to extract information from the samples, such as
wallet identifiers and mining pools. Together with OSINT data, this information
is used to group samples into campaigns. We then analyze publicly-available
payments sent to the wallets from mining-pools as a reward for mining, and
estimate profits for the different campaigns. All this together is is done in a
fully automated fashion, which enables us to leverage measurement-based
findings of illicit crypto-mining at scale. Our profit analysis reveals
campaigns with multi-million earnings, associating over 4.4% of Monero with
illicit mining. We analyze the infrastructure related with the different
campaigns, showing that a high proportion of this ecosystem is supported by
underground economies such as Pay-Per-Install services. We also uncover novel
techniques that allow criminals to run successful campaigns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00846v2,cs.CR

cybersecurity community's ongoing efforts to strategically mine threat
intelligence from OSINT data on the web. OSINT sources such as social media,
blogs, and dark web vulnerability markets exist in diverse languages and hinder
security analysts, who are unable to draw conclusions from intelligence in
languages they don't understand. Although third party translation engines are
growing stronger, they are unsuited for private security environments. First,
sensitive intelligence is not a permitted input to third party engines due to
privacy and confidentiality policies. In addition, third party engines produce
generalized translations that tend to lack exclusive cybersecurity terminology.
In this paper, we address these issues and describe our system that enables
threat intelligence understanding across unfamiliar languages. We create a
neural network based system that takes in cybersecurity data in a different
language and outputs the respective English translation. The English
translation can then be understood by an analyst, and can also serve as input
to an AI based cyber-defense system that can take mitigative action. As a proof
of concept, we have created a pipeline which takes Russian threats and
generates its corresponding English, RDF, and vectorized representations. Our
network optimizes translations on specifically, cybersecurity data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07517v1,cs.CL

crime for well-being and safety of the society. Images shared on social media
hurting religious, political, communal and other sentiments of people, often
instigate violence and create law & order situations in society. This results
in the need for first responders to inspect the spread of such images and users
propagating them on social media. In this paper, we present a comparison
between different hand-crafted features and a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) model to retrieve similar images, which outperforms state-of-art
hand-crafted features. We propose an Open-Source-Intelligent (OSINT) real-time
image search system, robust to retrieve modified images that allows first
responders to analyze the current spread of images, sentiments floating and
details of users propagating such content. The system also aids officials to
save time of manually analyzing the content by reducing the search space on an
