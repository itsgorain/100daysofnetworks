intelligence and in particular machine learning to active matter systems.
Active matter is composed of agents, or particles, that are capable of
propelling themselves. While biological agents like bacteria, fish or birds
naturally possess a certain degree of ""intelligence"", synthetic active
particles like colloidal microswimmers and electronic robots can be equipped
with different levels of artificial intelligence, either internally (as for
robots) or via a dynamic external control system. This book chapter briefly
discusses existing approaches to make synthetic particles increasingly
""intelligent"" and then focuses on the usage of machine learning to approach
navigation and communication problems of active particles. Basic questions are
how to steer a single active agent through a complex environment to reach or
discover a target in an optimal way and how active particles need to cooperate
to efficiently collect a distribution of targets (e.g. nutrients or toxins)
from their complex environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08632v1,cond-mat.soft

to measure intelligence. This raises the question whether systems based on
Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly o3, demonstrate intelligence and
progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Building on the
distinction between skills and intelligence made by Fran\c{c}ois Chollet, the
creator of ARC-AGI, a new understanding of intelligence is introduced: an agent
is the more intelligent, the more efficiently it can achieve the more diverse
goals in the more diverse worlds with the less knowledge. An analysis of the
ARC-AGI benchmark shows that its tasks represent a very specific type of
problem that can be solved by massive trialling of combinations of predefined
operations. This method is also applied by o3, achieving its high score through
the extensive use of computing power. However, for most problems in the
physical world and in the human domain, solutions cannot be tested in advance
and predefined operations are not available. Consequently, massive trialling of
predefined operations, as o3 does, cannot be a basis for AGI - instead, new
approaches are required that can reliably solve a wide variety of problems
without existing skills. To support this development, a new benchmark for
intelligence is outlined that covers a much higher diversity of unknown tasks
to be solved, thus enabling a comprehensive assessment of intelligence and of
progress towards AGI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07458v1,cs.AI

potential to redefine numerous sectors of human civilization. While Artificial
Intelligence has evolved from speculative fiction to a pivotal element of
technological progress, its role as a truly transformative agent, or
transformative Artificial Intelligence, remains a subject of debate. This work
explores the historical precedents of technological breakthroughs, examining
whether Artificial Intelligence can achieve a comparable impact, and it delves
into various ethical frameworks that shape the perception and development of
Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, it considers the societal, technical,
and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for Artificial Intelligence to
become a catalyst for global change. We also examine not only the strategies
and methodologies that could lead to transformative Artificial Intelligence but
also the barriers that could ultimately make these goals unattainable. We end
with a critical inquiry into whether reaching a transformative Artificial
Intelligence might compel humanity to adopt an entirely new ethical approach,
tailored to the complexities of advanced Artificial Intelligence. By addressing
the ethical, social, and scientific dimensions of Artificial Intelligence's
development, this work contributes to the broader discourse on the long-term

techniques discovered by humans in history while the human brain is widely
recognized as one of the most complex systems in the universe. One fundamental
critical question which would affect human sustainability remains open: Will

of AI techniques for neuroscience could approximate the brain and its
functioning systems (e.g. perception and cognition functions) with any expected
small error and AI without restrictions could surpass human intelligence with
probability one in the end. This paper indirectly proves the validity of the
conjecture made by Frank Rosenblatt 70 years ago about the potential
capabilities of AI, especially in the realm of artificial neural networks.
Intelligence is just one of fortuitous but sophisticated creations of the

from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects,
and it is also core to much of the work on emergence and self-organisation in
complex systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is
still much more to be understood in the relationship between specific
psychological processes at the individual level and the emergence of
self-organised structures at the social level. Previously psychological factors
have played a relatively minor role in the study of collective intelligence as
the principles are often quite general and applicable to humans just as readily
as insects or other agents without sophisticated psychologies. In this article
we emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad
applicability of collective intelligence principles while the mechanisms and
time-scales differ significantly between examples. We contend that flexible
collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by our use of a
specific cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We identify several key
characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show
that the development of a Theory of Mind is a crucial factor distinguishing
social collective intelligence from general collective intelligence. We then

understanding, evaluating, and developing their social intelligence are
becoming increasingly important. While multiple existing works have
investigated the social intelligence of LLMs, (1) most focus on a specific
aspect, and the social intelligence of LLMs has yet to be systematically
organized and studied; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a
third-person perspective, such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) tests. Compared to
the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation
can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios. (3) a lack of
comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on
incorporating critical human-machine interaction scenarios. In light of this,

distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the
relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence

to achieve both individual and collective goals. The incorporation of
artificial agents into human spaces is making increasing demands on artificial
intelligence (AI) to demonstrate and facilitate this ability. However, this
kind of flexibility is not well understood because existing approaches to
intelligence typically focus either on the individual or the collective level
of analysis. At the individual level, intelligence is seen as an
individual-difference trait that exists independently of the social
environment. At the collective level intelligence is conceptualized as a
property of groups, but not in a way that can be used to understand how groups
can make group members smarter or how group members acting as individuals might
make the group itself more intelligent. In the present paper we argue that by
focusing either on individual or collective intelligence without considering
their interaction, existing conceptualizations of intelligence limit the
potential of people and machines. To address this impasse, we identify and
explore a new kind of intelligence - socially-minded intelligence - that can be
applied to both individuals (in a social context) and collectives (of
individual minds). From a socially-minded intelligence perspective, the
potential intelligence of individuals is unlocked in groups, while the
potential intelligence of groups is maximized by the flexible,
context-sensitive commitment of individual group members. We propose ways in
which socially-minded intelligence might be measured and cultivated within
people, as well as how it might be modelled in AI systems. Finally, we discuss
ways in which socially-minded intelligence might be used to improve human-AI

science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning,
problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in
geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information
representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic
processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive
framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still
lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian
geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and
consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a
high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the
interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming
manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential
activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the
navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process,
perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides
feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction
errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds,
thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates
new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of
intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of
intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a
unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of
intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial
intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical
validation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11024v5,cs.AI

principles. The study assesses this approach via three operant learning tasks
using OpenNARS for Applications (ONA): simple discrimination, changing
contingencies, and conditional discrimination tasks.
  In the simple discrimination task, NARS demonstrated rapid learning,
achieving perfect accuracy during both training and testing phases. The
changing contingencies task showcased NARS's adaptability, as it successfully
adjusted its behavior when task conditions were reversed. In the conditional
discrimination task, NARS handled complex learning scenarios effectively,
achieving high accuracy by forming and utilizing intricate hypotheses based on
conditional cues.

of insufficient knowledge and resources, coupled with its sensorimotor
reasoning capabilities, establishes it as a robust model for AGI. The Machine
Psychology framework, by incorporating elements of natural intelligence such as

computation. This conceptualization is intended to provide a unified view for

proposed conceptualization explains the differences among existing views by
different computational paradigms, such as digital, analog, mechanical, or

computations from different paradigms, the challenges posed by previous
conceptualizations are resolved. Intelligence is hypothesized as a
multi-paradigmatic computation relying on specific computational principles.

Existing efforts primarily focus on generating and evaluating explanations for
black-box models while a critical gap in directly enhancing models remains
through these evaluations. It is important to consider the potential of this
explanation process to improve model quality with a feedback on training as
well. XAI may be used to improve model performance while boosting its
explainability. Under this view, this paper introduces Transformation -
Selective Hidden Input Evaluation for Learning Dynamics (T-SHIELD), a
regularization family designed to improve model quality by hiding features of
input, forcing the model to generalize without those features. Within this
family, we propose the XAI - SHIELD(X-SHIELD), a regularization for explainable
artificial intelligence, which uses explanations to select specific features to
hide. In contrast to conventional approaches, X-SHIELD regularization
seamlessly integrates into the objective function enhancing model
explainability while also improving performance. Experimental validation on
benchmark datasets underscores X-SHIELD's effectiveness in improving
performance and overall explainability. The improvement is validated through

why the currently most popular approaches of artificial intelligence, i.e.,
centralized AI (CEAI), are questionable, with other directions also being
widely explored, such as decentralized artificial intelligence (DEAI), to solve
some of the most reaching problems. This paper provides a systematic literature

the full spectrum of intelligence facets, including crystallized intelligence,
fluid intelligence, social intelligence, and embodied intelligence. To assess
the multidimensional intelligence of large models, the AGI tests consist of a

research, and public perception, on Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly
since the rise of generative- and large-language models. Most work on precisely
capturing what we mean by ""intelligence"" has come from the fields of
philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science. Because these perspectives are
intrinsically linked to intelligence as it is demonstrated by natural
creatures, we argue such fields cannot, and will not, provide a sufficiently
rigorous definition that can be applied to artificial means. Thus, we present
an argument for a purely functional, black-box definition of intelligence,
distinct from how that intelligence is actually achieved; focusing on the
""what"", rather than the ""how"". To achieve this, we first distinguish other
related concepts (sentience, sensation, agency, etc.) from the notion of
intelligence, particularly identifying how these concepts pertain to artificial
intelligent systems. As a result, we achieve a formal definition of
intelligence that is conceptually testable from only external observation, that
suggests intelligence is a continuous variable. We conclude by identifying
challenges that still remain towards quantifiable measurement. This work

artificial intelligence security: threats studied in academia do not always
reflect the practical use and security risks of AI. For example, while models
are often studied in isolation, they form part of larger ML pipelines in
practice. Recent works also brought forward that adversarial manipulations
introduced by academic attacks are impractical. We take a first step towards
describing the full extent of this disparity. To this end, we revisit the
threat models of the six most studied attacks in AI security research and match
them to AI usage in practice via a survey with 271 industrial practitioners. On
the one hand, we find that all existing threat models are indeed applicable. On
the other hand, there are significant mismatches: research is often too
generous with the attacker, assuming access to information not frequently
available in real-world settings. Our paper is thus a call for action to study
more practical threat models in artificial intelligence security.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09994v2,cs.CR

because there is no reliable method for ensuring that AGI goals stay aligned
with human goals. Drawing on publicly available forecaster and opinion data,
the author examines how experts and non-experts perceive risk from AGI. The
findings indicate that the perceived risk of a world catastrophe or extinction
from AGI is greater than for other existential risks. The increase in perceived
risk over the last year is also steeper for AGI than for other existential

systems that can perform a variety of tasks commonly found in human
intelligence tests, such as defining words, performing calculations, and
engaging in verbal reasoning. There are also substantial individual differences
in LLM capacities. Given the consistent observation of a positive manifold and
general intelligence factor in human samples, along with group-level factors
(e.g., crystallized intelligence), we hypothesized that LLM test scores may
also exhibit positive intercorrelations, which could potentially give rise to
an artificial general ability (AGA) factor and one or more group-level factors.
Based on a sample of 591 LLMs and scores from 12 tests aligned with fluid
reasoning (Gf), domain-specific knowledge (Gkn), reading/writing (Grw), and
quantitative knowledge (Gq), we found strong empirical evidence for a positive
manifold and a general factor of ability. Additionally, we identified a
combined Gkn/Grw group-level factor. Finally, the number of LLM parameters
correlated positively with both general factor of ability and Gkn/Grw factor
scores, although the effects showed diminishing returns. We interpreted our
results to suggest that LLMs, like human cognitive abilities, may share a
common underlying efficiency in processing information and solving problems,
though whether LLMs manifest primarily achievement/expertise rather than
intelligence remains to be determined. Finally, while models with greater

these into a parsimonious macroscopic framework centered on solving, planning

expressed in informational units or in units relative to goal difficulty, the
latter defined as complexity relative to system (individual or benchmarked)
ability. I present general equations for intelligence and its components, and a
simple expression for the evolution of intelligence traits. The measures

mobile devices that are now considered essential (e.g., camera and voice
assistants, recommender systems). Yet, operating artificial intelligence takes
up a substantial amount of energy. However, artificial intelligence is also
being used to enable more energy-efficient solutions for mobile systems. Hence,
artificial intelligence has two faces in that regard, it is both a key enabler
of desired (efficient) mobile functionalities and a major power draw on these
devices, playing a part in both the solution and the problem. In this paper, we
present a review of the literature of the past decade on the usage of
artificial intelligence within the realm of green mobile computing. From the
analysis of 34 papers, we highlight the emerging patterns and map the field
into 13 main topics that are summarized in details.
  Our results showcase that the field is slowly increasing in the past years,
more specifically, since 2019. Regarding the double impact AI has on the mobile
energy consumption, the energy consumption of AI-based mobile systems is
under-studied in comparison to the usage of AI for energy-efficient mobile
computing, and we argue for more exploratory studies in that direction. We
observe that although most studies are framed as solution papers (94%), the
large majority do not make those solutions publicly available to the community.
Moreover, we also show that most contributions are purely academic (28 out of

human brain, artificial intelligence builds computational models that have
learning capabilities and perform intelligent tasks approaching the human
level. Deep neural networks consist of multiple computation layers to learn
representations of data and improve the state-of-the-art in many recognition
domains. However, the essence of intelligence commonly represented by both
humans and AI is unknown. Here, we show that the nature of intelligence is a
series of mathematically functional processes that minimize system entropy by
establishing functional relationships between datasets over the space and time.
Humans and AI have achieved intelligence by implementing these entropy-reducing
processes in a reinforced manner that consumes energy. With this hypothesis, we
establish mathematical models of language, unconsciousness and consciousness,
predicting the evidence to be found by neuroscience and achieved by AI
engineering. Furthermore, a conclusion is made that the total entropy of the
universe is conservative, and the intelligence counters the spontaneous
processes to decrease entropy by physically or informationally connecting
datasets that originally exist in the universe but are separated across the
space and time. This essay should be a starting point for a deeper
understanding of the universe and us as human beings and for achieving
sophisticated AI models that are tantamount to human intelligence or even

within a context; 3) they operate based on a value system that underpins task
generation; and 4) they have a world model reflecting reality, which shapes
their interaction with the world. Building on this viewpoint, we highlight the
missing pieces in artificial general intelligence, that is, the unity of
knowing and acting. We argue that active engagement with objects in the real

next generation of artificial intelligence requires quantum computing.
Artificial intelligence is increasingly playing a crucial role in many aspects
of our daily lives and is central to the fourth industrial revolution. It is
therefore imperative that artificial intelligence is reliable and trustworthy.
However, there are still many issues with reliability of artificial
intelligence, such as privacy, responsibility, safety, and security, in areas
such as autonomous driving, healthcare, robotics, and others. These problems
can have various causes, including insufficient data, biases, and robustness
problems, as well as fundamental issues such as computability problems on
digital hardware. The cause of these computability problems is rooted in the
fact that digital hardware is based on the computing model of the Turing
machine, which is inherently discrete. Notably, our findings demonstrate that
digital hardware is inherently constrained in solving problems about
optimization, deep learning, or differential equations. Therefore, these
limitations carry substantial implications for the field of artificial
intelligence, in particular for machine learning. Furthermore, although it is
well known that the quantum computer shows a quantum advantage for certain
classes of problems, our findings establish that some of these limitations
persist when employing quantum computing models based on the quantum circuit or

should be based on in order to imitate the realistic process of taking
decisions by humans experiencing emotions. Two approaches are compared, one
based on quantum theory and the other employing classical terms. Both these
approaches have a number of similarities, being principally probabilistic. The
analogies between quantum measurements under intrinsic noise and affective
decision making are elucidated. It is shown that cognitive processes have many
features that are formally similar to quantum measurements. This, however, in
no way means that for the imitation of human decision making Affective
Artificial Intelligence has necessarily to rely on the functioning of quantum
systems. Appreciating the common features between quantum measurements and
decision making helps for the formulation of an axiomatic approach employing
only classical notions. Artificial Intelligence, following this approach,
operates similarly to humans, by taking into account the utility of the
considered alternatives as well as their emotional attractiveness. Affective
Artificial Intelligence, whose operation takes account of the cognition-emotion
duality, avoids numerous behavioural paradoxes of traditional decision making.
A society of intelligent agents, interacting through the repeated multistep
exchange of information, forms a network accomplishing dynamic decision making.
The considered intelligent networks can characterize the operation of either a
human society of affective decision makers, or the brain composed of neurons,
or a typical probabilistic network of an artificial intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08112v1,cs.AI

be known as the Fermi Paradox - the disquieting idea that, if extraterrestrial
life is probable in the Universe, then why have we not encountered it? This
conundrum has puzzled scholars for decades, and many hypotheses have been
proposed suggesting both naturalistic and sociological explanations. One
intriguing hypothesis is known as the Great Filter, which suggests that some
event required for the emergence of intelligent life is extremely unlikely,
hence the cosmic silence. A logically equivalent version of this hypothesis --
and one that should give us pause -- suggests that some catastrophic event is
likely to occur that prevents life's expansion throughout the cosmos. This
could be a naturally occurring event, or more disconcertingly, something that
intelligent beings do to themselves that leads to their own extinction. From an
intelligence perspective, framing global catastrophic risk (particularly risks
of anthropogenic origin) within the context of the Great Filter can provide
insight into the long-term futures of technologies that we don't fully

different domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three
recognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning

show improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts
of the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the
data gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured and
the technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum
manual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating

capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is
increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems--motivated
by recent techno-scientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics,

for gaining trust in relevant claims. A reproducibility crisis has been

this work we examine the collective intelligent behaviour of theoretical
universal agents by introducing a weighted mixture operation. Given a weighted
set of agents, their weighted mixture is a new agent whose expected total
reward in any environment is the corresponding weighted average of the original
agents' expected total rewards in that environment. Thus, if RL agent
intelligence is quantified in terms of performance across environments, the
weighted mixture's intelligence is the weighted average of the original agents'
intelligences. This operation enables various interesting new theorems that
shed light on the geometry of RL agent intelligence, namely: results about
symmetries, convex agent-sets, and local extrema. We also show that any RL
agent intelligence measure based on average performance across environments,
subject to certain weak technical conditions, is identical (up to a constant
factor) to performance within a single environment dependent on said

predominantly technical discipline into a field that is deeply intertwined with
social sciences. Insights such as human preference for contrastive -- more
precisely, counterfactual -- explanations have played a major role in this
transition, inspiring and guiding the research in computer science. Other
observations, while equally important, have nevertheless received much less
consideration. The desire of human explainees to communicate with artificial
intelligence explainers through a dialogue-like interaction has been mostly
neglected by the community. This poses many challenges for the effectiveness
and widespread adoption of such technologies as delivering a single explanation
optimised according to some predefined objectives may fail to engender
understanding in its recipients and satisfy their unique needs given the
diversity of human knowledge and intention. Using insights elaborated by Niklas
Luhmann and, more recently, Elena Esposito we apply social systems theory to
highlight challenges in explainable artificial intelligence and offer a path
forward, striving to reinvigorate the technical research in the direction of
interactive and iterative explainers. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the
potential of systems theoretical approaches to communication in elucidating and

teach them how to plan better. A recent and promising approach to improving
human decision-making is to create intelligent tutors that utilize AI to
discover and teach optimal planning strategies automatically. Prior work has
shown that this approach can improve planning in artificial, fully observable
planning tasks. Unlike these artificial tasks, the world is only partially
observable. To bridge this gap, we developed and evaluated the first
intelligent tutor for planning in partially observable environments. Compared
to previous intelligent tutors for teaching planning strategies, this novel
intelligent tutor combines two innovations: 1) a new metareasoning algorithm
for discovering optimal planning strategies for large, partially observable
environments, and 2) scaffolding the learning processing by having the learner
choose from an increasing larger set of planning operations in increasingly
larger planning problems. We found that our new strategy discovery algorithm is
superior to the state-of-the-art. A preregistered experiment with 330
participants demonstrated that the new intelligent tutor is highly effective at
improving people's ability to make good decisions in partially observable
environments. This suggests our human-centered tutoring approach can
successfully boost human planning in complex, partially observable sequential
decision problems, a promising step towards using AI-powered intelligent tutors

in locomotion, is considered an important factor in biological intelligence.
Lateralization has been associated with both poor and good performance. It has
been hypothesized that lateralization has benefits that may counterbalance its
costs. Given that lateralization is ubiquitous, it likely has advantages that
can benefit artificial intelligence. In turn, lateralized artificial
intelligent systems can be used as tools to advance the understanding of
lateralization in biological intelligence. Recently lateralization has been
incorporated into artificially intelligent systems to solve complex problems in
computer vision and navigation domains. Here we describe and test two novel
lateralized artificial intelligent systems that simultaneously represent and
address given problems at constituent and holistic levels. The experimental
results demonstrate that the lateralized systems outperformed state-of-the-art
non-lateralized systems in resolving complex problems. The advantages arise
from the abilities, (i) to represent an input signal at both the constituent
level and holistic level simultaneously, such that the most appropriate
viewpoint controls the system; (ii) to avoid extraneous computations by
generating excite and inhibit signals. The computational costs associated with
the lateralized AI systems are either less than the conventional AI systems or

fact that human behavior is inherently shaped by the cultural contexts they are
embedded in, the values and beliefs they hold, and the social practices they
follow. Additionally, since AI technologies are mostly conceived and developed
in just a handful of countries, they embed the cultural values and practices of
these countries. Similarly, the data that is used to train the models also
fails to equitably represent global cultural diversity. Problems therefore
arise when these technologies interact with globally diverse societies and
cultures, with different values and interpretive practices. In this position
paper, we describe a set of cultural dependencies and incongruencies in the
context of AI-based language and vision technologies, and reflect on the
possibilities of and potential strategies towards addressing these

algorithms is transforming many industries and aspects of the human experience.
One very important industry trend is the move to convert existing human
dwellings to smart buildings, and to create new smart buildings. Smart
buildings aim to mitigate climate change by reducing energy consumption and
associated carbon emissions. To accomplish this, they leverage artificial
intelligence, big data, and machine learning algorithms to learn and optimize
system performance. These fields of research are currently very rapidly
evolving and advancing, but there has been very little guidance to help
engineers and architects working on smart buildings apply artificial
intelligence algorithms and technologies in a systematic and effective manner.
In this paper we present B-SMART: the first reference architecture for
autonomic smart buildings. B-SMART facilitates the application of artificial
intelligence techniques and technologies to smart buildings by decoupling
conceptually distinct layers of functionality and organizing them into an
autonomic control loop. We also present a case study illustrating how B-SMART
can be applied to accelerate the introduction of artificial intelligence into
an existing smart building.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03219v1,cs.AI

expected to influence their environments, and, by way of their environments, to
influence themselves. Thus, it is unclear if an AI system's inputs will be
independent of its outputs, and, therefore, if AI systems can be treated as
traditional components. This paper posits that engineering general intelligence
requires new general systems precepts, termed the core and periphery, and
explores their theoretical uses. The new precepts are elaborated using abstract
systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety. By using the presented

(AGI) should start from a much lower level than human-level intelligence. The
circumstances of intelligent behavior in nature resulted from an organism
interacting with its surrounding environment, which could change over time and
exert pressure on the organism to allow for learning of new behaviors or
environment models. Our hypothesis is that learning occurs through interpreting
sensory feedback when an agent acts in an environment. For that to happen, a
body and a reactive environment are needed. We evaluate a method to evolve a
biologically-inspired artificial neural network that learns from environment
reactions named Neuroevolution of Artificial General Intelligence (NAGI), a
framework for low-level AGI. This method allows the evolutionary
complexification of a randomly-initialized spiking neural network with adaptive
synapses, which controls agents instantiated in mutable environments. Such a
configuration allows us to benchmark the adaptivity and generality of the
controllers. The chosen tasks in the mutable environments are food foraging,
emulation of logic gates, and cart-pole balancing. The three tasks are
successfully solved with rather small network topologies and therefore it opens
up the possibility of experimenting with more complex tasks and scenarios where

If a machine could understand, should we attribute subjectivity to it? This
paper addresses the problem of deciding whether the so-called ""intelligent
machines"" are capable of understanding, instead of merely processing signs. It
deals with the relationship between syntaxis and semantics. The main thesis
concerns the inevitability of semantics for any discussion about the
possibility of building conscious machines, condensed into the following two
tenets: ""If a machine is capable of understanding (in the strong sense), then
it must be capable of combining rules and intuitions""; ""If semantics cannot be
reduced to syntaxis, then a machine cannot understand."" Our conclusion states
that it is not necessary to attribute understanding to a machine in order to
explain its exhibited ""intelligent"" behavior; a merely syntactic and

the range of operations that it can display in the current state of

Dyadic Deontic Logic, implement this formalization in the Isabelle theorem

coheres with expected properties of Kantian ethic. My system is an early step

devices with sensing, computing, and communication capabilities have motivated
intelligent applications empowered by artificial intelligence. The classical
artificial intelligence algorithms require centralized data collection and
processing which are challenging in realistic intelligent IoT applications due
to growing data privacy concerns and distributed datasets. Federated Learning
(FL) has emerged as a distributed privacy-preserving learning framework that
enables IoT devices to train global model through sharing model parameters.
However, inefficiency due to frequent parameters transmissions significantly
reduce FL performance. Existing acceleration algorithms consist of two main
type including local update considering trade-offs between communication and
computation and parameter compression considering trade-offs between
communication and precision. Jointly considering these two trade-offs and
adaptively balancing their impacts on convergence have remained unresolved. To
solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel efficient adaptive federated
optimization (EAFO) algorithm to improve efficiency of FL, which minimizes the
learning error via jointly considering two variables including local update and

performed, at the centre of which is the assessment of the optic cup and disc
boundaries. Fundus imaging is non-invasive and low-cost; however, the image
examination relies on subjective, time-consuming, and costly expert
assessments. A timely question to ask is can artificial intelligence mimic
glaucoma assessments made by experts. Namely, can artificial intelligence
automatically find the boundaries of the optic cup and disc (providing a
so-called segmented fundus image) and then use the segmented image to identify
glaucoma with high accuracy. We conducted a comprehensive review on artificial
intelligence-enabled glaucoma detection frameworks that produce and use
segmented fundus images. We found 28 papers and identified two main approaches:
1) logical rule-based frameworks, based on a set of simplistic decision rules;
and 2) machine learning/statistical modelling based frameworks. We summarise
the state-of-art of the two approaches and highlight the key hurdles to
overcome for artificial intelligence-enabled glaucoma detection frameworks to
be translated into clinical practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05591v1,cs.CV

intelligence have achieved a lot of successes in various tasks, while we still
do not have a clear definition of ""intelligence"" with enough consensus in the
community (although there are over 70 different ""versions"" of definitions). The
nature of intelligence is still in darkness. In this work we do not take any of
these three traditional approaches, instead we try to identify certain
fundamental aspects of the nature of intelligence, and construct a mathematical
model to represent and potentially reproduce these fundamental aspects. We
first stress the importance of defining the scope of discussion and granularity
of investigation. We carefully compare human and artificial intelligence, and
qualitatively demonstrate an information abstraction process, which we propose
to be the key to connect perception and cognition. We then present the broader
idea of ""concept"", separate the idea of self model out of the world model, and
construct a new model called world-self model (WSM). We show the mechanisms of
creating and connecting concepts, and the flow of how the WSM receives,
processes and outputs information with respect to an arbitrary type of problem

awareness in artificial agents and those same agents simultaneously achieving
human or superhuman level intelligence. In this work, we explore the validity
and potential application of this seemingly intuitive link between
consciousness and intelligence. We do so by examining the cognitive abilities
associated with three contemporary theories of conscious function: Global
Workspace Theory (GWT), Information Generation Theory (IGT), and Attention
Schema Theory (AST). We find that all three theories specifically relate
conscious function to some aspect of domain-general intelligence in humans.
With this insight, we turn to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
find that, while still far from demonstrating general intelligence, many
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have begun to incorporate key aspects of
each of the three functional theories. Having identified this trend, we use the
motivating example of mental time travel in humans to propose ways in which
insights from each of the three theories may be combined into a single unified
and implementable model. Given that it is made possible by cognitive abilities
underlying each of the three functional theories, artificial agents capable of
mental time travel would not only possess greater general intelligence than
current approaches, but also be more consistent with our current understanding
of the functional role of consciousness in humans, thus making it a promising

that there is a need for research on the intersection between game theory and

intelligence that can navigate social dilemmas well. We consider the problem of
how an external agent can promote cooperation between artificial learners by
distributing additional rewards and punishments based on observing the actions

right incentives by considering the anticipated parameter updates of each
agent. Using this learning rule leads to cooperation with high social welfare
in matrix games in which the agents would otherwise learn to defect with high
probability. We show that the resulting cooperative outcome is stable in
certain games even if the planning agent is turned off after a given number of

Nor is it apparent that the outcomes of AGI in a system can be well expressed

practical and theoretical use for meta-theories of learning which do not
express themselves explicitly in terms of solution methods. General systems
theory offers such a meta-theory. Herein, Mesarovician abstract systems theory
is used as a super-structure for learning. Abstract learning systems are
formulated. Subsequent elaboration stratifies the assumptions of learning
systems into a hierarchy and considers the hierarchy such stratification
projects onto learning theory. The presented Mesarovician abstract learning

the bearer of AI. Then we show that the mainstream definitions of

intelligence to an insect. We then summarise the highly useful definition of
basic (arthropod) intelligence proposed by Rodney Brooks, and we identify the
properties that an AI agent would need to possess in order to be the bearer of
intelligence by this definition. Finally, we show that, from the perspective of
the disciplines needed to create such an agent, namely mathematics and physics,

system under study (e.g., an excerpt of reality). As a result of the conceptual
modeling process a human interpretable, formalized representation (i.e., a
conceptual model) is derived which enables understanding and communication
among humans, and processing by machines. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms are also applied to complex realities (regularly represented by vast
amounts of data) to identify patterns or to classify entities in the data.
Aside from the commonalities of both approaches, a significant difference can
be observed by looking at the results. While conceptual models are
comprehensible, reproducible, and explicit knowledge representations, AI
techniques are capable of efficiently deriving an output from a given input
while acting as a black box. AI solutions often lack comprehensiveness and
reproducibility. Even the developers of AI systems can't explain why a certain
output is derived. In the Conceptual Modeling meets Artificial Intelligence
(CMAI) workshop, we are interested in tackling the intersection of the two,
thus far, mostly isolated approached disciplines of CM and AI. The workshop

and control of an AGI (artificial general intelligence), building upon an
explanation of The Fermi Paradox and preceding work on symbol emergence and
artificial general intelligence. The latter suggests that to infer what someone
means, an agent constructs a rationale for the observed behaviour of others.
Communication then requires two agents labour under similar compulsions and
have similar experiences (construct similar solutions to similar tasks). Any
non-human intelligence may construct solutions such that any rationale for
their behaviour (and thus the meaning of their signals) is outside the scope of
what a human is inclined to notice or comprehend. Further, the more compressed
a signal, the closer it will appear to random noise. Another intelligence may
possess the ability to compress information to the extent that, to us, their
signals would appear indistinguishable from noise (an explanation for The Fermi
Paradox). To facilitate predictive accuracy an AGI would tend to more
compressed representations of the world, making any rationale for their
behaviour more difficult to comprehend for the same reason. Communication with
and control of an AGI may subsequently necessitate not only human-like
compulsions and experiences, but imposed cognitive impairment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01835v1,cs.AI

intelligence is the data required for data-centric artificial intelligence
agents (e.g., neural networks) are less diverse in contents than the data
required to explain the decisions of such agents to humans. The idea is that a
classifier can attain high accuracy using data that express a phenomenon from
one perspective whereas the audience of explanations can entail multiple
stakeholders and span diverse perspectives. We hence propose to use domain
knowledge to complement the data used by agents. We formulate knowledge-based
explainable artificial intelligence as a supervised data classification problem
aligned with the CBR methodology. In this formulation, the inputs are case
problems composed of both the inputs and outputs of the data-centric agent and
case solutions, the outputs, are explanation categories obtained from domain
knowledge and subject matter experts. This formulation does not typically lead
to an accurate classification, preventing the selection of the correct
explanation category. Knowledge-based explainable artificial intelligence
extends the data in this formulation by adding features aligned with domain
knowledge that can increase accuracy when selecting explanation categories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10363v1,cs.AI

framework for testing the capabilities of the agent in a variety of

general intelligence where a population of intelligent agents are instantiated

survivability of the agents are defined by the fitness, with respect to the
explainability and predictability, of a resource-bounded computational model of
the environment. This general learning approach is then employed to model the
physics of an environment based on subjective observer states of the agents. A

used to train an artificial intelligence agent with such a capability. The
training entails millions of flow simulations with varying reservoir model
descriptions (structural, rock and fluid properties), operational constraints,
and economic conditions. The parameters that define the reservoir model,
operational constraints, and economic conditions are randomly sampled from a
defined range of applicability. Several algorithmic treatments are introduced
to enhance the training of the artificial intelligence agent. After appropriate
training, the artificial intelligence agent provides an optimized field
development plan instantly for new scenarios within the defined range of
applicability. This approach has advantages over traditional optimization
algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm) that are
generally used to find a solution for a specific field development scenario and
typically not generalizable to different scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00527v1,cs.LG

competitors that they defeat; and second, one specific (somewhat arbitrary)
method for measuring said growth rates. Whereas Hibbard's intelligence measure
is based on the latter growth-rate-measuring method, we survey other methods
for measuring function growth rates, and exhibit the resulting Hibbard-like
intelligence measures and taxonomies. Of particular interest, we obtain
intelligence taxonomies based on Big-O and Big-Theta notation systems, which

compare attributions of blame and wrongness across human, artificial, and group

emotion detector, artificial intelligence (AI). To date, researchers proposed
many factors that may affect happiness such as wealth, health and safety. Even
though these factors all seem relevant, there is no clear consensus between
sociologists on how to interpret these, and the models to estimate the cost of
these utilities include some assumptions. Researchers in social sciences have
been working on determination of the happiness levels in society and
exploration of the factors correlated with it through polls and different
statistical methods. In our work, by using artificial intelligence, we
introduce a different and relatively unbiased approach to this problem. By
using AI, we make no assumption about what makes a person happy, and leave the
decision to AI to detect the emotions from the faces of people collected from
publicly available street footages. We analyzed the happiness levels in eight
different cities around the world through available footage on the Internet and
found out that there is no statistically significant difference between
countries in terms of happiness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12548v1,cs.AI

changing with highly advanced artificially intelligent systems that demonstrate
incredible capabilities to autonomously (i.e., with minimal or no human input)
produce creative products that would ordinarily deserve intellectual property
status if created by a human. These systems could be called artificial creators

intellectual property regimes (that are inherently designed to reward human

critically, reflexively, it can result in negative outcomes for humanity. For
this reason, several researchers in the area have developed a robust,
beneficial, and safe concept of AI for the preservation of humanity and the
environment. Currently, several of the open problems in the field of AI
research arise from the difficulty of avoiding unwanted behaviors of
intelligent agents and systems, and at the same time specifying what we really
want such systems to do, especially when we look for the possibility of
intelligent agents acting in several domains over the long term. It is of
utmost importance that artificial intelligent agents have their values aligned
with human values, given the fact that we cannot expect an AI to develop human
moral values simply because of its intelligence, as discussed in the
Orthogonality Thesis. Perhaps this difficulty comes from the way we are
addressing the problem of expressing objectives, values, and ends, using
representational cognitive methods. A solution to this problem would be the
dynamic approach proposed by Dreyfus, whose phenomenological philosophy shows
that the human experience of being-in-the-world in several aspects is not well
represented by the symbolic or connectionist cognitive method, especially in
regards to the question of learning values. A possible approach to this problem
would be to use theoretical models such as SED (situated embodied dynamics) to
address the values learning problem in AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02783v1,cs.CY

knowing agent. This is motivated by efforts within artificial intelligence
research to define real-number intelligence levels of complicated intelligent
systems. Our agents are more idealized, which allows us to define a much
simpler measure of intelligence level for them. In short, we define the
intelligence level of a mechanical knowing agent to be the supremum of the
computable ordinals that have codes the agent knows to be codes of computable
ordinals. We prove that if one agent knows certain things about another agent,
then the former necessarily has a higher intelligence level than the latter.
This allows our intelligence notion to serve as a stepping stone to obtain
results which, by themselves, are not stated in terms of our intelligence
notion (results of potential interest even to readers totally skeptical that
our notion correctly captures intelligence). As an application, we argue that
these results comprise evidence against the possibility of intelligence
explosion (that is, the notion that sufficiently intelligent machines will
eventually be capable of designing even more intelligent machines, which can
then design even more intelligent machines, and so on).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09571v1,cs.AI

artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we
need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables
comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the
past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and
measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize
and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making
apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly
guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still
gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited
by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We
argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring
intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and
experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to
""buy"" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's
own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of
intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence
as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope,
generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we
propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like.
Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors
designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC
can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that
it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547v2,cs.AI

through the lens of interaction with reward-giving environments, attempting to

than measure numeric intelligence of one Legg- Hutter agent, how can we compare
the relative intelligence of two Legg-Hutter agents? We propose an elegant
answer based on the following insight: we can view Legg-Hutter agents as
candidates in an election, whose voters are environments, letting each
environment vote (via its rewards) which agent (if either) is more intelligent.
This leads to an abstract family of comparators simple enough that we can prove

project is crucial for projects managers and decision-makers. Existing methods,

project cost prediction. However, these methods are unable to produce accurate
results for conceptual cost prediction due to small and unstable data samples.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms include
numerous models and algorithms for supervised regression applications.
Therefore, a comparison analysis for AI models is required to guide
practitioners to the appropriate model. The study focuses on investigating
twenty artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which are conducted for cost
modeling such as fuzzy logic (FL) model, artificial neural networks (ANNs),
multiple regression analysis (MRA), case-based reasoning (CBR), hybrid models,
and ensemble methods such as scalable boosting trees (XGBoost). Field canals

rapid growth in skills of dataprocessing and analysis and gain qualitatively
different functionalities, at least until the current computing technology

general systems in contrast to very narrow and restricted (human pre-defined)
domain systems, in analogy to how the brain works. Self-constructive Artificial
Intelligence ($SCAI$) is one such possible framework. We herein propose that
$SCAI$ is based on three principles of organization: self-growing,
self-experimental and self-repairing. Self-growing: the ability to autonomously
and incrementally construct structures and functionality as needed to solve
encountered (sub)problems. Self-experimental: the ability to internally
simulate, anticipate and take decisions based on these expectations.
Self-repairing: the ability to autonomously re-construct a previously
successful functionality or pattern of interaction lost from a possible
sub-component failure (damage). To implement these principles of organization,
a constructive architecture capable of evolving adaptive autonomous agents is
required. We present Schema-based learning as one such architecture capable of
incrementally constructing a myriad of internal models of three kinds:
predictive schemas, dual (inverse models) schemas and goal schemas as they are
necessary to autonomously develop increasing functionality.
  We claim that artificial systems, whether in the digital or in the physical
world, can benefit very much form this constructive architecture and should be
organized around these principles of organization. To illustrate the generality
of the proposed framework, we include several test cases in structural adaptive
navigation in artificial intelligence systems in Paper II of this series, and
resilient robot motor control in Paper III of this series. Paper IV of this
series will also include $SCAI$ for problem structural discovery in predictive

the games of chess, shogi and Go, which raises two open questions. Firstly, as
there is a finite number of possibilities in the game, is there a quantifiable

Secondly, AlphaZero introduces sophisticated reinforcement learning and
self-play to efficiently encode the possible states, is there a simple
information-theoretic model to represent the learning process and offer more
insights in fostering strong AI systems?
  This paper explores the above two questions by proposing a simple variance of
Shannon's communication model, the concept of intelligence entropy and the
Unified Intelligence-Communication Model is proposed, which provide an
information-theoretic metric for investigating the intelligence level and also
provide an bound for intelligent agents in the form of Shannon's capacity,
namely, the intelligence capacity. This paper then applies the concept and
model to AlphaZero as a case study and explains the learning process of
intelligent agent as turbo-like iterative decoding, so that the learning
performance of AlphaZero may be quantitatively evaluated. Finally, conclusions

forefront. The ultimate goal of AI is to realize machines with human mind and
consciousness, but existing achievements mainly simulate intelligent behavior
on computer platforms. These achievements all belong to weak AI rather than
strong AI. How to achieve strong AI is not known yet in the field of
intelligence science. Currently, this field is calling for a new paradigm,
especially Theory of Cognitive Relativity (TCR). The TCR aims to summarize a
simple and elegant set of first principles about the nature of intelligence, at
least including the Principle of World's Relativity and the Principle of
Symbol's Relativity. The Principle of World's Relativity states that the
subjective world an intelligent agent can observe is strongly constrained by
the way it perceives the objective world. The Principle of Symbol's Relativity
states that an intelligent agent can use any physical symbol system to express
what it observes in its subjective world. The two principles are derived from
scientific facts and life experience. Thought experiments show that they are
important to understand high-level intelligence and necessary to establish a
scientific theory of mind and consciousness. Rather than brain-like
intelligence, the TCR indeed advocates a promising change in direction to
realize true AI, i.e. artificial general intelligence or artificial
consciousness, particularly different from humans' and animals'. Furthermore, a
TCR creed has been presented and extended to reveal the secrets of
consciousness and to guide realization of conscious machines. In the sense that
true AI could be diversely implemented in a brain-different way, the TCR would
probably drive an intelligence revolution in combination with some additional
first principles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00136v3,cs.AI

artificial intelligence having a ""World Model"", this paper propose an unified
intelligence-communication (UIC) model for describing a single agent and any
multi-agent system.
  Firstly, the environment is modelled as the generic communication channel
between agents. Secondly, the UIC model adopts a learning-agent model for
unifying several well-adopted agent architecture, e.g. rule-based agent model
in complex adaptive systems, layered model for describing human-level
intelligence, world-model based agent model. The model may also provide an
unified approach to investigate a multi-agent system (MAS) having multiple
action-perception modalities, e.g. explicitly information transfer and implicit
information transfer.
  This treatise would be divided into three parts, and this first part provides
an overview of the UIC model without introducing cumbersome mathematical
analysis and optimizations. In the second part of this treatise, case studies
with quantitative analysis driven by the UIC model would be provided,
exemplifying the adoption of the UIC model in multi-agent system. Specifically,
two representative cases would be studied, namely the analysis of a natural
multi-agent system, as well as the co-design of communication, perception and
action in an artificial multi-agent system. In the third part of this treatise,
the paper provides further insights and future research directions motivated by
the UIC model, such as unification of single intelligence and collective
intelligence, a possible explanation of intelligence emergence and a dual model

2018-11-07 22:05:45+00:00,Contrastive Explanation: A Structural-Model Approach,['Tim Miller'],"This paper presents a model of contrastive explanation using structural
casual models. The topic of causal explanation in artificial intelligence has
gathered interest in recent years as researchers and practitioners aim to
increase trust and understanding of intelligent decision-making. While
different sub-fields of artificial intelligence have looked into this problem
with a sub-field-specific view, there are few models that aim to capture
explanation more generally. One general model is based on structural causal
models. It defines an explanation as a fact that, if found to be true, would
constitute an actual cause of a specific event. However, research in philosophy
and social sciences shows that explanations are contrastive: that is, when
people ask for an explanation of an event -- the fact -- they (sometimes
implicitly) are asking for an explanation relative to some contrast case; that
is, ""Why P rather than Q?"". In this paper, we extend the structural causal
model approach to define two complementary notions of contrastive explanation,
and demonstrate them on two classical problems in artificial intelligence:
classification and planning. We believe that this model can help researchers in
subfields of artificial intelligence to better understand contrastive
explanation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03163v2,cs.AI
2018-11-06 18:37:04+00:00,A Model for General Intelligence,['Paul Yaworsky'],"The overarching problem in artificial intelligence (AI) is that we do not
understand the intelligence process well enough to enable the development of
adequate computational models. Much work has been done in AI over the years at
lower levels, but a big part of what has been missing involves the high level,
abstract, general nature of intelligence. We address this gap by developing a
model for general intelligence. To accomplish this, we focus on three basic
aspects of intelligence. First, we must realize the general order and nature of
intelligence at a high level. Second, we must come to know what these
realizations mean with respect to the overall intelligence process. Third, we
must describe these realizations as clearly as possible. We propose a
hierarchical model to help capture and exploit the order within intelligence.
The underlying order involves patterns of signals that become organized, stored
and activated in space and time. These patterns can be described using a
simple, general hierarchy, with physical signals at the lowest level,
information in the middle, and abstract signal representations at the top. This
high level perspective provides a big picture that literally helps us see the
intelligence process, thereby enabling fundamental realizations, a better
understanding and clear descriptions of the intelligence process. The resulting
model can be used to support all kinds of information processing across
multiple levels of abstraction. As computer technology improves, and as
cooperation increases between humans and computers, people will become more
efficient and more productive in performing their information processing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02546v2,cs.AI

techniques to imbue machines with human-like general intelligence. Yet even the
currently predominant data-driven approaches in AI seem to be lacking humans'
unique ability to solve wide ranges of problems. This situation begs the
question of the existence of principles that underlie general problem-solving
capabilities. We approach this question through the mathematical formulation of
analogies across different problems and solutions. We focus in particular on
problems that could be represented as tree-like structures. Most importantly,
we adopt a category-theoretic approach in formalising tree problems as
categories, and in proving the existence of equivalences across apparently
unrelated problem domains. We prove the existence of a functor between the
category of tree problems and the category of solutions. We also provide a
weaker version of the functor by quantifying equivalences of problem categories

motivating the discussion with examples from poker-playing artificial

provides definitions, and cites examples for each of the modes: accidental
steering, coordination failures, adversarial misalignment, input spoofing and
filtering, and goal co-option or direct hacking. The paper then discusses how

Specifically, we propose a partition structure that contains pre-allocated
abstraction neurons; we formulate abstraction learning as a constrained
optimization problem, which integrates abstraction properties; we develop a

collaborative performance. Improv is a humorous and playful artform built on an
open-ended narrative structure which simultaneously celebrates effort and
failure. It is thus an ideal test bed for the development and deployment of
interactive artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational agents, or
artificial improvisors. This case study introduces an improv show experiment
featuring human actors and artificial improvisors. We have previously developed
a deep-learning-based artificial improvisor, trained on movie subtitles, that
can generate plausible, context-based, lines of dialogue suitable for theatre
(Mathewson and Mirowski 2017). In this work, we have employed it to control
what a subset of human actors say during an improv performance. We also give
human-generated lines to a different subset of performers. All lines are
provided to actors with headphones and all performers are wearing headphones.
This paper describes a Turing test, or imitation game, taking place in a
theatre, with both the audience members and the performers left to guess who is
a human and who is a machine. In order to test scientific hypotheses about the
perception of humans versus machines we collect anonymous feedback from
volunteer performers and audience members. Our results suggest that rehearsal
increases proficiency and possibility to control events in the performance.
That said, consistency with real world experience is limited by the interface
and the mechanisms used to perform the show. We also show that human-generated
lines are shorter, more positive, and have less difficult words with more

systems to perform the intellectual and creative functions of a person,
independently find ways to solve problems, be able to draw conclusions and make
decisions. Most artificial intelligence systems have the ability to learn,
which allows people to improve their performance over time. The recent research
on AI tools, including machine learning, deep learning and predictive analysis
intended toward increasing the planning, learning, reasoning, thinking and
action taking ability. Based on which, the proposed research intends towards
exploring on how the human intelligence differs from the artificial
intelligence. Moreover, we critically analyze what AI of today is capable of
doing, why it still cannot reach human intelligence and what are the open
challenges existing in front of AI to reach and outperform human level of
intelligence. Furthermore, it will explore the future predictions for
artificial intelligence and based on which potential solution will be
recommended to solve it within next decades.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01396v1,cs.AI

social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable
growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years,
AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as
Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India.
The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence
information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although
recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain
patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on
big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather
than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we
aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition
technology called Beyond AI. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent
learning model called Brain Intelligence (BI) that generates new ideas about
events without having experienced them by using artificial life with an imagine
function. We will also conduct demonstrations of the developed BI intelligence
learning model on automatic driving, precision medical care, and industrial
robots.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01040v1,cs.CV

created in the context of our human intelligence. We suggest that the
fundamental difference between human and machine intelligence comes down to
\emph{embodiment factors}. We define embodiment factors as the ratio between an

speculate on the role of embodiment factors in driving our own intelligence and
consciousness. We briefly review dual process models of cognition and cast
machine intelligence within that framework, characterising it as a dominant
System Zero, which can drive behaviour through interfacing with us
subconsciously. Driven by concerns about the consequence of such a system we
suggest prophylactic courses of action that could be considered. Our main
conclusion is that it is \emph{not} sentient intelligence we should fear but

defined point solution, is in contrast to the bio-inspired view of intelligence
as an outcome, perhaps formed from a tapestry of events, cross-pollinated by
instances, each with its own microcosm of experiences and learning, which may
not be discrete all-or-none functions but continuous, over space and time. The
enterprise world may not require, aspire or desire such an engaged solution to
improve its services for enabling digital transformation through the deployment

prevent a superhuman intelligence from modifying itself, even if protection
mechanisms against this action are put in place. Without evolutionary pressure,
sufficiently advanced artificial intelligences become inert by simplifying
their own utility function. Within evolutionary processes, the implicit utility
function is always reducible to persistence, and the control of superhuman
intelligences embedded in evolutionary processes is not possible. Mechanisms
against utility function self-modification are ultimately futile. Instead,

semimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent's estimate of the
probability of its death. We formally define death for generally intelligent
agents like AIXI, and prove a number of related theorems about their behaviour.

problem. In this paper we suggest an alternative to RL called value
reinforcement learning (VRL). In VRL, agents use the reward signal to learn a
utility function. The VRL setup allows us to remove the incentive to wirehead
by placing a constraint on the agent's actions. The constraint is defined in
terms of the agent's belief distributions, and does not require an explicit
specification of which actions constitute wireheading.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03143v1,cs.AI

Sigurðardóttir', 'Bas R. Steunebrink']","The concept of ""task"" is at the core of artificial intelligence (AI): Tasks
are used for training and evaluating AI systems, which are built in order to
perform and automatize tasks we deem useful. In other fields of engineering
theoretical foundations allow thorough evaluation of designs by methodical
manipulation of well understood parameters with a known role and importance;
this allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the
effects of wind speed on an airplane's performance and stability. No framework
exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance
results on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering)
cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more
acute with respect to artificial *general* intelligence systems, which must
handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A *task
theory* would enable addressing tasks at the *class* level, bypassing their
specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks,
environments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of
measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest
improvements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of
machine learning and AI evaluation. Here we discuss the main elements of the
argument for a task theory and present an outline of what it might look like
for physical tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04660v2,cs.AI

to reduce the impact of asymmetric information on decisions. With the advent of
artificial intelligence, signaling and screening have been made easier. This
paper studies the impact of artificial intelligence on the theory of asymmetric
information. It is surmised that artificial intelligent agents reduce the
degree of information asymmetry and thus the market where these agents are
deployed become more efficient. It is also postulated that the more artificial
intelligent agents there are deployed in the market the less is the volume of
trades in the market. This is because for many trades to happen the asymmetry

principles of intelligence that operate independently of a specific problem
domain or a predefined context and utilize these principles in order to
synthesize systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human being is
capable of and eventually go beyond that. While ""narrow"" artificial
intelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech
recognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion,
etc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding
general intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical
approach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief
introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number
of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the
concept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence
perceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a
priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative
process of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We
call this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed
as an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application
can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three
facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making
and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how
open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed,
self-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is
scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination
and intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number
of questions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.06366v2,cs.AI

computation. Therefore, in this work, we propose a quantification of
morphological computation, which is based on an information decomposition of
the sensorimotor loop into shared, unique and synergistic information. In

This paper attempts to give a more unifying definition that can be applied to
the natural world in general and then Artificial Intelligence. The definition
would be used more to qualify than quantify it and might help when making
judgements on the matter. While correct behaviour is the preferred definition,
a metric that is grounded in Kolmogorov's Complexity Theory is suggested, which
leads to a measurement about entropy. A version of an accepted AI test is then
put forward as the 'acid test' and might be what a free-thinking program would
try to achieve. Recent work by the author has been more from a direction of
mechanical processes, or ones that might operate automatically. This paper
agrees that intelligence is a pro-active event, but also notes a second aspect
to it that is in the background and mechanical. The paper suggests looking at
intelligence and the conscious as being slightly different, where the conscious
is this more mechanical aspect. In fact, a surprising conclusion can be a
passive but intelligent brain being invoked by active and less intelligent
senses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.1076v9,cs.AI

artificial intelligence. Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial
intelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed
incompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this
stance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of
artifical life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of
co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly
integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine
the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction
paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated
can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from
the environment. This proposition does not however resolve that of the
relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such
reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in
order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial
intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an
enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues,
thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of
morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of
minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the
problem of artificial intelligence in a variety of enaction-based ways.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6663v1,cs.AI

able to choose the appropriate problem and to specialize for a variety of
tasks. This is a feature which is an important contributor to the increase of
intelligence in a group (apart from the addition of more agents and the
improvement due to common decision making). Our results reveal some interesting
results about how (collective) intelligence can be modeled, about how
collective intelligence tests can be designed and about the underlying dynamics

human-interactive agents. The method is based on a key sociological insight
that has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,
but has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that
resource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective
consistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments
about identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient
affective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental
sentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent
with, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent
with, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This ""affect control
principle"" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In
this paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of
this principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively
intelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain
multiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability
distribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make
value-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively
intelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,
predicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking
actions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We
demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our
model can be used as an emotional ""plug-in"" for artificially intelligent
systems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice
assistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive
disability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.5279v2,cs.HC

Here we formulate the model of the perception of external world which may be
used for the description of perceptual activity of intelligent beings. We
consider a number of issues related to the development of the set of patterns

The key idea of the presented perception model is the idea of subjective
reality. The principle of the relativity of perceived world is formulated. It
is shown that this principle is the immediate consequence of the idea of
subjective reality. In this paper we show how the methodology of subjective

important factors will be increased. The first is energy saving in the
building. The second is customer value---how the people in the building

truth of this hypothesis through experimental findings related to tools for
artificial decision making. A number of assumptions related to agent control,
through monitoring and delegation of tasks to other kinds of agents, of rooms
at a test site are relaxed. Each assumption controls at least one uncertainty
that complicates considerably the procedures for selecting actions part of each
such agent. We show that in realistic decision situations, room-controlling

growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that
often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose
optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a
general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence
(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential
functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare
policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial
intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines
Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation
framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of
research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized

mathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of
Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to
many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of
papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete
mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and
rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing
intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the
philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of
rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.
Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally
investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough
has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique
that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain
knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of
interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to
play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without
even providing the rules of the games.
  These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General
Intelligence is not elusive.

on Hutter's Universal Artificial Intelligence theory, an extension of Ray
Solomonoff's pioneering work on universal induction. Since the Universal
Intelligence Measure is only asymptotically computable, building a practical
intelligence test from it is not straightforward. This paper studies the
practical issues involved in developing a real-world UIM-based performance

empirical techniques to measure the performance of algorithms in some specific
tasks (e.g., playing chess, solving mazes or land a helicopter). However, these
methods are not appropriate if we want to evaluate the general intelligence of
AI and, even less, if we compare it with human intelligence. The ANYNT project
has designed a new method of evaluation that tries to assess AI systems using
well known computational notions and problems which are as general as possible.
This new method serves to assess general intelligence (which allows us to learn
how to solve any new kind of problem we face) and not only to evaluate
performance on a set of specific tasks. This method not only focuses on
measuring the intelligence of algorithms, but also to assess any intelligent
system (human beings, animals, AI, aliens?,...), and letting us to place their
results on the same scale and, therefore, to be able to compare them. This new
approach will allow us (in the future) to evaluate and compare any kind of
intelligent system known or even to build/find, be it artificial or biological.
This master thesis aims at ensuring that this new method provides consistent
results when evaluating AI algorithms, this is done through the design and
implementation of prototypes of universal intelligence tests and their
application to different intelligent systems (AI algorithms and humans beings).
From the study we analyze whether the results obtained by two different
intelligent systems are properly located on the same scale and we propose
changes and refinements to these prototypes in order to, in the future, being
able to achieve a truly universal intelligence test.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.5072v1,cs.AI

increasing player satisfaction in games. But how do we know when an agent is
truly intelligent? A common point of reference in the AGI community is Legg and
Hutter's formal definition of universal intelligence, which has the appeal of
simplicity and generality but is unfortunately incomputable. Games of various
kinds are commonly used as benchmarks for ""narrow"" AI research, as they are
considered to have many important properties. We argue that many of these
properties carry over to the testing of general intelligence as well. We then
sketch how such testing could practically be carried out. The central part of

agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This
means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were
created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer
to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide
whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its
intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way.
The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the
execution of several environments, including those which are generated
randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once
the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter
will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and
rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a
result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible
environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to
determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests,
the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really
useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated
environment will serve that purpose.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.0714v1,cs.AI

paradigm focusing on the study of adaptive mechanisms to enable or facilitate
intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. There are several
paradigms of CI [like artificial neural networks, evolutionary computations,
swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fuzzy systems and many others],
each of these has its origins in biological systems [biological neural systems,
natural Darwinian evolution, social behavior, immune system, interactions of
organisms with their environment]. Most of those paradigms evolved into
separate machine learning (ML) techniques, where probabilistic methods are used
complementary with CI techniques in order to effectively combine elements of
learning, adaptation, evolution and Fuzzy logic to create heuristic algorithms
that are, in some sense, intelligent. The current trend is to develop consensus
techniques, since no single machine learning algorithms is superior to others
in all possible situations. In order to overcome this problem several
meta-approaches were proposed in ML focusing on the integration of results from
different methods into single prediction. We discuss here the Landau theory for
the nonlinear equation that can describe the adaptive integration of
information acquired from an ensemble of independent learning agents. The
influence of each individual agent on other learners is described similarly to
the social impact theory. The final decision outcome for the consensus system

combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility,

how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This
allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better
understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno
