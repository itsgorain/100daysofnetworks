Released on June 22, 2004, it features singer Jeff Tweedy on lead guitar more than any previous Wilco album. The band streamed the album online free, and offered a five-song EP to purchasers.\nTweedy entered a rehab clinic shortly before the release of the album, delaying its release by two weeks. It also shortened its promotional tour. Despite this, A Ghost Is Born's opening week was the best sales week for the band at the time, and the album was met with good reviews from major publications such as Rolling Stone and PopMatters. The album earned Wilco a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\n\n== Production ==\nWilco signed a contract with Nonesuch Records in November 2001 after a lengthy dispute with Reprise Records over the release of the band's fourth album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Foxtrot was welcomed with positive reviews from The Village Voice\u2014where the album was rated by the critics as the best album of 2002\u2014and Rolling Stone. It sold over 590,000 copies, earning a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n\n=== Composition ===\nRecording for a new album began in November 2003 under the working title Wilco Happens. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. O'Rourke encouraged lead singer Jeff Tweedy to develop his guitar skills for the album; Tweedy recently became the lead guitarist for the band due to the dismissal of Jay Bennett after the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot recording sessions. Tweedy sought to play solos on the album that were unlike those of jam bands such as Phish and The Grateful Dead. Instead, he performed composed solos influenced by Television such as the one during the coda of \"At Least That's What You Said\". Tweedy refers to the guitar solo at the end of the track as a \"musical transcription\" of one of his panic attacks. A Ghost Is Born was recorded in a manner different from Foxtrot or 1999's Summerteeth; whereas those recordings were performed live in the studio and then extensively de-constructed and arranged in Pro Tools, A Ghost Is Born was first performed live, edited and arranged in Pro Tools, and then performed and re-recorded with minimal overdubbing. Tweedy was excited about writing an album this way:\nAll those things you can do with Pro Tools and all the emotional buttons you can push with just purely sonic things I think can be done with just plain old music. I love all the possibilities that modern recording techniques allow, but I couldn't picture the idea of really wowing anyone with some crazy evolution of the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sound.\nAn unusual feature of A Ghost Is Born is the fifteen-minute long track \"Less Than You Think\". The first part of the song begins as a ballad which references belief systems and atheism which after 3 minutes, fades out. The second part consists of electronic drones and noise, intended to audibly represent the migraines that lead singer Jeff Tweedy had been suffering from while addicted to pain killers during the recording sessions for A Ghost Is Born. For the song, each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound. The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded. The noise, which served as the coda to the song, was remixed to provide dynamics to the track. Calling it \"the track that everyone will hate,\" Tweedy defended the song's inclusion on the album:\nI know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great \u2026 I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.\nA Ghost Is Born was the first Wilco album with pianist Mikael Jorgensen; he had previously worked as an engineer with the band on their collaboration with The Minus 5. Jeff Tweedy provided lead vocals and acted as lead guitarist for the only time since the band formed. John Stirratt, the only original member aside from Tweedy, played bass and guitar. Glenn Kotche and Jim O'Rourke, Tweedy's associates from Loose Fur, acted as drummer and multi-instrumentalist, respectively. Leroy Bach played a variety of keyboards as well as bass guitar. All members of the band contributed with a synthesizer part on \"Less Than You Think\".\n\n\n== Marketing and promotion ==\nWilco began touring in support of Ghost even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the recording sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.The band also webcast the album in its entirety on the Internet in a promotion with Apple Computer. Nonesuch was willing to allow the MPEG-4 broadcast due to the success of a similar broadcast in the promotion of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Additionally, Wilco offered a free EP to purchasers of the album. The EP featured two outtakes from the album\u2014\"Panthers\" and \"Kicking Television\"\u2014and live versions of \"At Least That's What You Said\", \"The Late Greats\", and \"Handshake Drugs\". The EP was later packaged with the album and sold as a \"deluxe version\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn its debut week, A Ghost Is Born peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold over 81,000 copies, the highest US chart peak and best sales week ever attained by the band at that time. The album was an international hit as well, peaking at number 24 in Norway, number 29 in Sweden, number 33 in New Zealand, number 34 in Belgium, and number 37 in Ireland. As of April 13, 2007, the album has sold over 340,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Like Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born was well received by critics. On Metacritic, the album holds a score of 81 out of 100 from 33 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone called A Ghost Is Born \"as eerie as anything Wilco have recorded yet\" and applauded Tweedy for offering \"illuminating curiosity about what can happen in a song.\" Billboard cited it as Wilco's \"most difficult and uncompromising album to date.\" Akiva Gottlieb of Stylus Magazine praised A Ghost Is Born as being \"even more brilliant\" than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, a sentiment echoed by Michael Metevier of PopMatters, who added that the album made him \"surprised and delighted enough to last several lifetimes.\" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club wrote that A Ghost Is Born \"channels its shaggy sound into pop music\" that \"constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence, but it's still hard not to hum along.\" James Hunter of The Village Voice felt that \"Wilco's ideas are unremarkable, but are worked out with intelligence and striking conception. And as it happens, the new organic emphasis tables some of Wilco's lamer stylistic obsessions.\" Q called the album \"more meandering\" than Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but also \"more confident, more coherent, yielding an all-enveloping warmth that's entirely resistant to any iPod shuffle function.\"Among mixed reviews, Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticized A Ghost Is Born as \"wildly uneven\" and \"less cohesive than any other Wilco release.\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called it a \"privileged self-indulgence\" due to its extreme musical dynamics. NME wrote of the album: \"It's like Scissor Sisters on tranquilisers. With a bit of ELO. And a dash of Ramones. And, with this eclecticism, a worrying lack of focus.\" Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune felt that the album possessed an \"incomplete\" quality which nonetheless can be \"quite intriguing, more of a side step than a forward leap, but a worthy experiment all the same.\" Ann Powers of Blender wrote that on first listen, the album is \"rather monotonous, a bunch of moderately singable tunes with some noise piled up around the edges\", but that it \"starts to insinuate meaning\" over subsequent listens.In 2005, A Ghost Is Born won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package. Although the band was nominated for Grammys for work on previous albums, this was the first time that they won one. The band only won one award, as the winner for Best Recording Package is credited towards the artist of the artwork, not the performer.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Jeff Tweedy except where noted.\nUS vinyl (8122-76492-1) \/  standard US CD (7559-79809-2)\nSide one\n\n\"At Least That's What You Said\" \u2013 5:33\n\"Hell Is Chrome\" (Tweedy, Mikael Jorgensen) \u2013 4:38\n\"Spiders (Kidsmoke)\" \u2013 10:46Side two\n\n\"Muzzle of Bees\" \u2013 4:56\n\"Hummingbird\" \u2013 3:11\n\"Handshake Drugs\" \u2013 6:07Side three\n\n\"Wishful Thinking\" (Tweedy, Glenn Kotche) \u2013 4:41\n\"Company in My Back\" \u2013 3:46\n\"I'm a Wheel\" \u2013 2:37\n\"Theologians\" (Tweedy, Jorgensen, Chris Girard) \u2013 3:36Side four\n\n\"Less Than You Think\" (Tweedy, John Stirratt, Kotche, Jorgensen, Leroy Bach, Jim O'Rourke) \u2013 15:04\n\"The Late Greats\" \u2013 2:31Limited edition two-CD set (7559-79892-2)\nCD one\n\n\"At Least That's What You Said\" \u2013 5:29\n\"Hell Is Chrome\" \u2013 4:33\n\"Spiders (Kidsmoke)\" \u2013 10:41\n\"Muzzle of Bees\" \u2013 4:51\n\"Hummingbird\" \u2013 3:06\n\"Handshake Drugs\" \u2013 6:02\n\"Wishful Thinking\" \u2013 4:37\n\"Company in My Back\" \u2013 3:42\n\"I'm a Wheel\" \u2013 2:33\n\"Theologians\" \u2013 3:31\n\"Less Than You Think\" \u2013 15:00\n\"The Late Greats\" \u2013 2:30CD two\n\n\"Panthers\" \u2013 3:49\n\"At Least That's What You Said\" (live) \u2013 5:53\n\"The Late Greats\" (live) \u2013 2:39\n\"Handshake Drugs\" (live) \u2013 6:12\n\"Kicking Television\" \u2013 2:49\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\"I'm a Wheel\" (July 26, 2004)\n7-inch vinyl only, \"I'm a Wheel\" b\/w \"Kicking Television\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Wilco ===\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 vocals (all tracks), electric guitar (1\u20134, 6, 9, 10), acoustic baritone 12-string guitar (4, 7), acoustic guitar (6\u20138, 10, 12), acoustic 6-string bass, loops, filters, synths (11)\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass (1, 3, 6\u201310, 12), electric guitar (2, 5), backing vocals (2\u20136), piano (4), acoustic guitar, loops, filters, synths (11)\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 drums (all tracks), hammered dulcimer (8, 11), percussion (8), loops, filters, synths (11)\nLeroy Bach \u2013 piano (1, 6, 8, 12), Korg CX-3 organ (2, 8), bass (4), vibes (7), electric guitar (9), acoustic guitar (10, 11), loops, filters, synths (11)\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 synthesizer (1, 8, 11), piano (2\u20135, 7, 10, 12), Rocksichord (3, 6), Farfisa organ (4, 7, 12), Stylophone (8)\n\n\n=== Additional musicians ===\nJim O'Rourke \u2013 piano (1, 3, 4, 10), bass (2, 5), electric guitar (3, 5, 6, 12), ARP 2600 (3), acoustic guitar (4, 8), Korg CX-3 organ (7), loops, filters, synths (11)\nFrankie Montuoro \u2013 hammered dulcimer (5)\nKaren Waltuch \u2013 viola (5)\nTim Barnes \u2013 percussion (6)\n\n\n=== Technical personnel ===\nWilco \u2013 production\nJim O'Rourke \u2013 production, mixing, engineering, mixing\nChris Shaw \u2013 engineer\nTJ Doherty \u2013 assistant engineer\nTim Iseler \u2013 assistant engineer\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 engineer\nSteve Rooke \u2013 mastering\nFrankie Montuoro \u2013 production assistant, technical assistance\nStan Doty, Daniel Herbst, Deborah Miles Johnson, Haydn Johnston, Matt Zivich \u2013 production assistants, technical assistance\nDan Nadel \u2013 graphic design\nPeter Buchanan-Smith \u2013 graphic design, photography\nMike Schmelling \u2013 photography\nGladys Nilsson \u2013 drawing\nKen Waagner \u2013 digital supervisor\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKot, Greg (2004).

The album was released only months after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album would be better than the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.\nAlthough A.M. was released before Son Volt's Trace, critical reviews were modest and initial sales were low. The album was later regarded as a \"failure\" by band members, as Trace was a greater success. It was the band's last album to be recorded in a purely alternative country style, as following the record the band began to expand their sound across multiple genres. It is also the only Wilco album to feature Brian Henneman of The Bottle Rockets as a lead guitarist.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\n\nUncle Tupelo's final album, Anodyne, featured a new lineup for the band\u2014a five-piece outfit with drummer Ken Coomer, bassist John Stirratt, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. Tensions mounted between singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy, and Uncle Tupelo played its last concert on May 1, 1994, at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, Missouri.Only days after the breakup, Tweedy decided to form a new group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band Wilco. In mid-May, the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired producer Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June. Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros,, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.Tweedy was preoccupied with trying to establish Wilco as a viable band on the Reprise label, and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist. Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan also contributed to the album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg mastered the album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design. Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett. Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco. However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one (\"It's Just That Simple\") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by Wilco not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any Wilco album.The album's title is intended to reference Top 40 radio stations, and the tracks reflect a straightforward country-rock sound. The band members felt that they needed to establish themselves outside of the Uncle Tupelo fanbase. However, Tweedy later stated that in actuality, they were \"trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.\" Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup, but decided that he didn't want any material on that subject to appear on the album. (It can be argued, however, that first single \"Box Full of Letters\", as well as \"Too Far Apart\" allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy's friendship and working relationship.) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in Wilco: Learning How to Die that \"Tweedy's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements; there's little sense of drama, and virtually no hint of risk.\" Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time. Shortly after the album, Tweedy stopped smoking pot, to which he credits the introspectiveness of further albums.While Wilco was recording tracks, Farrar formed a band of his own, Son Volt. Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album (also produced by Paulson), Trace, in November 1994. The fact that both Wilco and Son Volt began working on an album almost immediately after the Uncle Tupelo breakup caused debate among critics, fans, and Warner Bros. about which would be the better band. Joe McEwen, who originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner subsidiary, felt that Wilco was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne. McEwen urged Richard Dodd, who had recently mixed Tom Petty's Wildflowers, to remix the album. Dodd emphasized Tweedy's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio.Wilco began touring before the album was released. Their live debut was on November 27, 1994, at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, a venue where Uncle Tupelo had first received significant media attention. The band was billed for that concert as Black Shampoo, a reference to a 1970s B movie, and the show sold out. Wilco continued to tour for two hundred shows, culminating in a show at the South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin, Texas, in March 1995. A.M. was released on Reprise Records on March 28, 1995.\n\n\n== Commercial and critical reception ==\nA.M. received modest reviews from critics. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone called the album \"one hell of a country-guts debut\", praising the influence of Gram Parsons and Neil Young on the music. However, the album still received a moderate three-and-a-half star rating. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a three-star honorable mention, but called it \"realist defiance grinding sadly down into realist bathos.\" The Village Voice placed the album at position 34 on the 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. The band was disappointed by the critical reception, since Trace was met with better reviews. According to Henneman:\nThe first Son Volt record was pretty fucking good. It was like watching a prize fight at that point. Wow! He slammed him there! Ouch! What a counterpunch! It was exciting being on the sidelines watching these guys. It's like Jay had something to prove with that first album, an urgency to it that none of his albums since have had. I felt he had a chip on his shoulder, and it shows up in the music. It was stunning. It was humbling. I think that kicked Jeff in the ass.\nA.M. hit number 27 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, whereas Trace peaked at number 166 on the Billboard 200; by 1997, Trace had outsold A.M. two-to-one. Wilco released \"Box Full of Letters\" as a single, but it received little airplay.  For the only time in Wilco's career, ticket sales failed to meet expectations. As of 2003, the album had sold about 150,000 copies.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Jeff Tweedy unless otherwise noted.\n\n\"I Must Be High\" \u2013 2:59\n\"Casino Queen\" \u2013 2:45\n\"Box Full of Letters\" \u2013 3:05\n\"Shouldn't Be Ashamed\" \u2013 3:28\n\"Pick Up the Change\" \u2013 2:56\n\"I Thought I Held You\" \u2013 3:49\n\"That's Not the Issue\" \u2013 3:19\n\"It's Just That Simple\" (John Stirratt) \u2013 3:45\n\"Should've Been in Love\" \u2013 3:36\n\"Passenger Side\" \u2013 3:33\n\"Dash 7\" \u2013 3:29\n\"Blue Eyed Soul\" \u2013 4:05\n\"Too Far Apart\" \u2013 3:44\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJeff Tweedy - vocals (1-7,9-13), guitar (1,3,13), acoustic guitar (2,4-7,9-12), bass (8)\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass (1-7,9,10,12,13), vocals (2,3,6,8), piano (6), acoustic guitar (8), organ (13)\nKen Coomer \u2013 drums (1-10,12,13), vocals (2)\nMax Johnston \u2013 dobro (1,3,9,13), fiddle (2,10), vocals (2), mandolin (4,8,10,12), banjo (5-7)\nBrian Henneman \u2013 guitar (1-9,12,13), vocals (2), small stoned guitar (10)\nDaniel Corrigan \u2013 vocals (2)\nLloyd Maines \u2013 pedal steel guitar (1,6,8,11,12)\nWilco, Brian Henneman and Daniel Corrigan \u2013 handclaps, crowd noise, glass cheers (2)\n\n\n=== Production ===\nDaniel Corrigan \u2013 photography\nJames SK W\u0101n - wardrobe\nRichard Dodd \u2013 mixing\nBarbara Longo \u2013 design\nBrian Paulson \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing\nHowie Weinberg \u2013 mastering\nWilco \u2013 producer, engineer\nBob Andrews \u2013 Production Coordinator\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKot, Greg (2004).

Despite its release as a double album, Being There was sold at a single album price as a result of a deal between lead singer Jeff Tweedy and the band's label Reprise Records. The album was an improvement for the band in both sales and critical reception, in contrast to their debut album A.M. (1995). Taking its name from the 1979 film of the same name, the self-produced album featured more surrealistic and introspective writing than on A.M. This was due in part to several significant changes in Tweedy's life, including the birth of his first child. Musically, it juxtaposed the alternative country styles songs reminiscent of Uncle Tupelo with psychedelic, surreal songs. It was the only Wilco album with steel guitarist Bob Egan, their first with multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett and their last with multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJeff Tweedy formed Wilco in 1994 after creative differences between Jay Farrar and Tweedy caused the breakup of Uncle Tupelo. The band entered the recording studio almost immediately afterwards to record and release A.M. in 1995, which saw disappointing sales. Jay Farrar's new band Son Volt released Trace in late 1995 to critical praise and good sales numbers. Trace also provided a college rock hit song in \"Drown\", which entered the top ten of the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, further increasing competition between the two bands.Tweedy felt that Wilco was incomplete without a second guitarist due to the departure of Brian Henneman after the A.M. recording sessions. Wilco's road manager Bob Andrews helped Tweedy get in contact with Jay Bennett, a multi-instrumentalist who had been looking for a new band to join since his power pop band Titanic Love Affair had been dismissed from its record label. Bennett joined Wilco after Tweedy sent him a few Uncle Tupelo songs and a copy of A.M.; Tweedy had been intrigued by the fact that Bennett could play keyboards, an instrument no other Wilco member played.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe first conceptions of material for the album came during a particularly stressful time in Tweedy's life. Tweedy had recently quit smoking marijuana, attendance at Wilco concerts was dwindling, and Tweedy was trying to manage his marriage, a mortgage, and the birth of his first child. He responded to these pressures:\nI was a later bloomer. I was in my thirties before I even came to terms with the idea that I was making a living as a recording artist. I was in a punk band for a long time and thought it was my life. I was a bass player in a band making fifty dollars a night, paying eighty dollars a month in rent, making indie records and not getting paid for them, and having this naive sense of well-being that I would always do this and never have much more responsibility than that. I went from that to being a dad and a major-label recording artist who had the pressure of supporting a family and also making something I felt good about artistically.\nFor Being There, Tweedy wanted to blend the experiences he had making music with the ones he had listening to music. One of the first songs that Tweedy wrote was \"Misunderstood\", a song about a tortured musical artist from the point of view of a fan. The song contains several overt references to the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, including the addition of insults that Farrar used against Tweedy\u2014specifically one calling him a \"mama's boy\". Part of the song's lyrics (\"Take the guitar player for a ride\/See, he ain't never been satisfied\/He thinks he owes some kind of debt\/Be years before he gets over it\") are originally from Peter Laughner, an underground alternative rock artist from Cleveland that died at 24 in 1977, taken from his song \"Amphetamine\". The song concludes with the artist lashing out against the listener with satirical self-pity, a rebellion against the way that fans saw Uncle Tupelo as only an archetype of Gram Parsons inspired country rock. To induce a feeling of chaos on the track, the members of Wilco recorded a track where the members switched to novel instruments and placed sections of it into the song. The theme of a \"tortured artist\" is found in other songs as well; the end of \"Sunken Treasure\" features Tweedy calling for the renewal of his youth as a punk rocker.A dichotomy of musical styling was featured in the album's songs. \"Hotel Arizona\", \"Sunken Treasure\", and \"Misunderstood\" featured personal language and more surrealism compared to alternative country songs such as \"The Lonely 1\" and \"Far, Far Away\". To enhance this dichotomy between simple and surreal, each song was practiced, recorded, and mixed in only one day. The album's name was taken from the 1979 comedy Being There, because the band believed that Peter Sellers' character Chance had an analogous mentality to the mindset of the album. Wilco sought to incorporate influences from other bands, but not to an overbearing degree; however, they were unable to accomplish this with songs like the Rolling Stones-influenced \"Monday\". Unlike radio-friendly A.M., the band had no preference about whether Being There could yield radio hits.When the recording sessions were done, Wilco had originally recorded thirty songs, but were able to cut it down to nineteen songs covering a span of seventy-seven minutes. Tweedy decided that he wanted to release all of the material as a double CD, but was concerned that consumers would be reluctant to purchase it. The purchasing price of a double album was at least $30, but single albums cost (at most) $17.98. Tweedy approached record executive Joe McEwen, who had originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner Brothers label, about selling Being There at a single album price. McEwen was reluctant at first, but was able to convince Reprise Records president Howie Klein to adhere to Tweedy's request. To compensate for the financial loss that the label would take, Tweedy agreed to cut most of his royalties for the album. By 2003, it was estimated that he lost nearly $600,000 because of this, but Tweedy remained satisfied by the deal.Being There was the only Wilco album with Freakwater's Bob Egan. Egan was invited to come to the studio after Freakwater opened for Wilco for a few shows. He only played on two tracks (\"Far, Far Away\" and \"Dreamer in My Dreams\"), but accompanied the band on the support tour. It was the last album for multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston, who left because he was undergoing marital problems and believed that Bennett was taking over his place in the band. Jeff Tweedy performed as the lead singer and secondary guitarist. Jay Bennett was the lead guitarist, and also played a variety of other instruments. John Stirratt played bass guitar and Ken Coomer played drums. All members of the band played a different instrument on \"Misunderstood\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBeing There was received positively by critics. AllMusic editor Jason Ankeny gave the album a four-and-a-half stars and referred to it as \"the group's great leap forward.\" He praised the band's ability to juxtapose psychedelia and power pop with tracks that \"wouldn't sound at all out of place on Exile on Main Street\". Greg Kot, writing for Rolling Stone, gave the album four stars and lauded how it \"venture[d] out into an anxiety-ridden world sure thing ... the solace they continue to find in rock and roll.\" Robert Christgau was more modest, writing \"there's no point in denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as you recognize its insularity.\" Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called Wilco \"massively improved as both a band and as songwriters\" but also noted that \"the two-disc set is really nothing more than a marketing scheme.\" Being There was ranked the 14th best album of the year on The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996. In 2003, Pitchfork named it the 88th best album of the 1990s. In 2004, Stylus Magazine placed 178th on their \"Top 101\u2013200 Favorite Albums of All-Time\" list. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.The album was a marked improvement over A.M. on the Billboard charts. It peaked at number 73 on the Billboard 200, whereas A.M. failed to hit the chart at all. \"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\" was released as a single, and received moderate airplay on some college rock radio stations.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Jeff Tweedy.

In 1987 the album was again released along with the album Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy (1983) and the EP Between the Wars (1985) and titled Back to Basics. Back to Basics was reissued in 1990. Brewing Up with Billy Bragg was reissued on its own in 1997.[1]\nIn 2006, as part of a planned series of reissues of albums in his back catalogue, Brewing Up with Billy Bragg was remastered and reissued for the first time on CD with a number of bonus tracks. These tracks included covers of \"Back to the Old House\" by The Smiths (with Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr playing guitar) and \"The Last Time\" by The Rolling Stones. The bonus tracks also include the Between the Wars EP.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBrewing Up with Billy Bragg was ranked number six among the \"Albums of the Year\" for 1984 by NME.In 2000, Q placed Brewing Up with Billy Bragg at number 87 on its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Billy Bragg, except where noted.\n\n\n=== Disc one ===\n\"It Says Here\" \u2013 4:18\n\"Love Gets Dangerous\" \u2013 2:23\n\"The Myth of Trust\" \u2013 2:54\n\"From a Vauxhall Velox\" \u2013 2:31\n\"The Saturday Boy\" \u2013 3:30\n\"Island of No Return\" \u2013 3:37\n\"St Swithin's Day\" \u2013 3:54\n\"Like Soldiers Do\" \u2013 2:39\n\"This Guitar Says Sorry\" \u2013 2:31\n\"Strange Things Happen\" \u2013 2:38\n\"A Lover Sings\" \u2013 3:54\n\n\n=== Disc two (2006 reissue) ===\n\"It Must Be a River\" \u2013 2:19\n\"I Won't Talk About It\" \u2013 5:06\n\"Talking Wag Club Blues\" \u2013 2:59\n\"You Got the Power\" (James Brown, George Terry) \u2013 3:10\n\"The Last Time\" (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards) \u2013 2:55\n\"Back to the Old House\" (Morrissey, Johnny Marr) \u2013 2:53\n\"A Lover Sings\" (alternative version) \u2013 3:58\n\"Which Side Are You On?\" (Florence Reece, Bragg) \u2013 2:34\n\"It Says Here\" (alternate version) \u2013 2:36\n\"Between the Wars\" \u2013 2:30\n\"The World Turned Upside Down\" (Leon Rosselson) \u2013 2:35\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\nBilly Bragg \u2013 vocals, guitar\nDave Woodhead \u2013 trumpet\nKenny Craddock \u2013 organ\n\n\n=== Production ===\nEdward de Bono \u2013 producer\nKenny Jones \u2013 engineer\nTim Young \u2013 digitally remastered by\nDuncan Cowell \u2013 digitally remastered by\nHeeps Willard - cover illustration\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nOfficial Billy Bragg discography\n2006 reissue CD liner notes","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Star_empty.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/51\/Star_full.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/81\/Star_half.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/ce\/Brewing_up.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"],"links":["A New England","Album","AllMusic","Andrew Collins (broadcaster)","Ann Powers","Anti-war","Audio engineering","Back to Basics (Billy Bragg album)","Back to the Old House","Backing vocalist","Barney Bubbles","Berry Street Studio","Between the Wars (EP)","Between the Wars EP","Billy Bragg","Billy Bragg discography","Blender (magazine)","Bloke on Bloke","Bridges Not Walls","British folk rock","CD","Don't Try This at Home (Billy Bragg album)","England, Half-English","Entertainment Weekly","Eric Weisbard","Extended play","Fight Songs (Billy Bragg album)","Florence Reece","Folk punk","Gina Arnold","Go!

It was released on May 27, 2022, by dBpm Records. A double album, Cruel Country sees the band fully embracing their country music leanings. It was supported with the release of two singles: \"Falling Apart (Right Now)\" and \"Tired of Taking It Out on You\". On release, the album received critical acclaim and debuted at number 190 on the US Billboard 200.\n\n\n== Background ==\nCruel Country features twenty-one songs written by frontman Jeff Tweedy. The double album consists primarily of live takes recorded at The Loft, the band's recording studio in Chicago. The sessions included all six Wilco members together in The Loft for the first time since The Whole Love (2011). With minimal overdubbing, Tweedy compared their recording approach on Cruel Country to that which they last employed on Sky Blue Sky (2007).\n\n\n== Music and themes ==\nThe album sees the band fully embracing their country music leanings. In a letter published upon the album's announcement, Jeff Tweedy wrote, \"I think there's been an assumption over the years that Wilco is some sort of country band. There's a lot of evidence to support that way of thinking about our band because there have been elements of country music in everything we've ever done. But to be honest, we've never been particularly comfortable with accepting that definition of the music we make. With this album though, I'll tell you what, Wilco is digging in and calling it country.\" Tweedy explained that the genre provided an ideal space to explore United States history: \"Because it is the country I love, and because it's country music that I love, I feel a responsibility to investigate their mirrored problematic natures. I believe it's important to challenge our affections for things that are flawed.\"\n\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nTweedy first announced he was at work on a new Wilco album through his Substack newsletter in February 2022. The album was officially announced on April 28, 2022, with the single \"Falling Apart (Right Now)\" released the same day. The second single, \"Tired of Taking It Out on You\", was released on May 10, 2022. The album was released digitally on May 27, 2022, by dBpm Records, with physical releases on CD and LP planned for a later date due to the supply chain crisis. The release of Cruel Country coincided with Wilco's Solid Sound Festival at MASS MoCA, where the band performed the album in its entirety. A double LP and a two-disc CD were finally released by dBpm Records on January 20, 2023.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nCruel Country was met with critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on 17 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.Jon Pareles of The New York Times deemed it an \"understated magnum opus\", writing, \"A song can only do so much, and on Cruel Country Wilco offers no grand lesson or master plan, only observations, feelings and enigmas. Many of the album's best moments are wordless ones.\"\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nWilco\n\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 vocals, guitar, production, album design\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 drums\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 keyboards\nNels Cline \u2013 guitars\nPat Sansone \u2013 guitar, arrangement (tracks 3, 8)Additional personnel\n\nJennifer Kummer \u2013 French horn (tracks 3, 8)\nWilco \u2013 production\nTom Schick \u2013 production, engineering, mixing\nTeddy Morgan \u2013 engineering (tracks 3, 8)\nMark Greenberg \u2013 engineering assistance, album design\nBob Ludwig \u2013 mastering\nLawrence Azerrad \u2013 album design\nCrystal Myers \u2013 album design\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Star_empty.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/51\/Star_full.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/e\/e0\/Cruel_Country_%28Wilco%29.png","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"],"links":["2021\u20132022 global supply chain crisis","A.M.

And in 2011 he worked with So Percussion on a series of pieces called Drumkit Quartets as part of Meet the Composer's Three City Dash. In 2006, he released Mobile, which he started working on in various hotel rooms during Wilco tour when he couldn't practice the drums. Kotche has also collaborated with Chicago contemporary chamber music sextet Eighth Blackbird.In 1997, Kotche began collaborating with Portland, OR folk singer\/songwriter Bill Santen a.k.a. Birddog.

He has worked on more albums by both The Fall (15) & Billy Bragg (14) than any other producer, and continues to work with Bragg. Showbiz has been awarded Gold Records for The Smiths' Rank, Billy Bragg's Don't Try This At Home and The Wilco\/Bragg collaboration Mermaid Vol.1, and received Grammy nominations for both Mermaid Avenue Vols 1 & 2.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShowbiz started as a soundman for anarcho-hippypunks Here & Now in 1976. Showbiz ran the sound and stage at many free festivals such as Windsor and Stonehenge. Stamping his personality on proceedings, using a microphone plugged into the soundboard, he would often amiably harangue those onstage to get on with it, or off, as circumstances might merit. He quickly forged links with the punk scene, producing albums for Alternative TV & The Fall. In 1979 he set up the Ladbroke Grove-based Street-Level Studio with Kif Kif (ex drummer of Here & Now) & Jos\u00e9 Gross (ex keyboard player from Here & Now, guitarist from Blank Space and The Real Imitations), going on to record a swathe of bands including The Fall, Alternative TV, Mark Perrys' Good Missionaries, The Door And The Window, 012, World Domination Enterprises, The Mob, Impossible Dreamers, The Astronauts, Blyth Power, Brian Brain, The Petticoats, Androids Of Mu, The Instant Automatons & Take It - many released on the associated pioneering DIY record label Fuck Off Records. At this time Showbiz also began making music himself, playing bass in Blue Midnight (who he continues to record & play live with).\nThrough connections with Rough Trade Showbiz became The Smiths live sound engineer, working with them from their fifth gig until their last gig in 1986. He produced their live album  Rank and recorded their last ever tracks \"Work Is a Four Letter Word\" and \"I Keep Mine Hidden\". He filmed a backstage video Reel Around the Fountain of their 1984 UK tour and recorded most of their live shows.From 1989, Showbiz was member of studio-based band Moodswings until their 2002 album Horizontal.\nShowbiz continues to tour as sound engineer for Billy Bragg.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe is married to Frank Chickens frontwoman Kazuko Hohki.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Blue Midnight ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nLove Not Devotion\nLe Bal Des Idiots\nBlue Midnight\nFather Of Apples\nBalance\n\n\n==== Singles ====\nStreet-Level E.P.\nJust A Dream\n\n\n=== Billy Bragg ===\n\n\n==== Albums ====\nThe Internationale\nDon't Try This At Home\nWilliam Bloke\nBloke On Bloke\nMermaid Avenue Vol 1 (with Wilco & Natalie Merchant)\nReaching To The Converted\nMermaid Avenue Vol 2 (with Wilco)\nBill's Bargains\nMust I Paint You A Picture?

The film, distributed to theaters in the United States through Cowboy Pictures, was released on July 26, 2002, three months after the album's retail release.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nWith Wilco nearing completion of their album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, conflict arose between the band and its record label Reprise, a division of the Warner Music Group. Wilco's prior albums had not performed to Reprise's sales expectations and Reprise were concerned with how to market the new album. They consequently rejected the work and dropped Wilco from the label.\nWith a completed album and no contractual obligations to Reprise, Wilco made the album available to download on their website. Awareness of the new album became apparent and Wilco's profile was rising. In response, another record label, Nonesuch Records, offered Wilco a new record contract. Nonesuch Records, like Reprise, is a division of Warner Music Group, so Wilco were essentially paid twice for the album by the same record company.\nOther scenes depicted the breakdown of the relationship between members Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett, and Tweedy's debilitating migraines.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJeff Tweedy\nJohn Stirratt\nLeroy Bach\nGlenn Kotche\nJay Bennett\nTony Margherita\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn addition to regular theatrical releases throughout the United States, the film was an official selection of the Los Angeles Film Festival, where the film had its world premiere in June 2002.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 60 reviews, and an average rating of 6.92\/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Besides being a treat for Wilco fans, I Am Trying to Break Your Heart also exposes the workings of a profit-driven music industry.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews. Reviewing the film after its DVD release, The A.V. Club's Scott Tobias wrote, \"On hand with a 16mm black-and-white camera to document the recording process, director\/photographer Sam Jones came away with more than he bargained for in I Am Trying To Break Your Heart, a superb portrait of a band and an industry in flux.\" Chris Morris, reviewing the film for Billboard, wrote that it was \"one of the best films ever about the inevitable clash between art and commerce.\"\n\n\n== DVD releases ==\nA DVD of the film was distributed through Plexifilm and released on April 1, 2003.(Note that there are two versions of the film on DVD: The original two-disc set, and a newer version  which omits Disc 2 and is generally less expensive.)\nDisc 1\n\nThe film (digital transfer, 16x9 anamorphic presentation)\nFeature commentary from director Sam Jones and Wilco\nOriginal theatrical trailer\nEnglish subtitles for the hearing impairedDisc 2\n\nOver 70 minutes of extra footage, featuring 17 additional Wilco songs, alternate versions of songs from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, live concert performances and new unreleased songs\nI Am Trying To Make A Film making-of featurettePlus:\n\nDeluxe 40-page booklet with filmmaker's diary, exclusive photos and liner notes from Rolling Stone's David Fricke\n\n\n=== DVD Disc 2 bonus track listing ===\n\"Pot Kettle Black\" *\n\"Busy Bee Monkey Song\" (also known as \"Monkey Mess\")\n\"Why Would You Wanna Live\"\n\"Pieholden Suite\" *\n\"Acuff-Rose\"\n\"Please Tell My Brother\"\n\"Cars Can't Escape\" *\n\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\" *\n\"Magazine Called Sunset\"\n\"Wait Up\"\n\"Radio Cure\" *\n\"Monday\"\n\"Someday Soon\"\n\"Bob Dylan's 49th Beard\"\n\"How to Fight Loneliness\"\n\"Not for the Season\"\n\"Sunken Treasure\"All songs written by Jeff Tweedy, except as noted *, written by Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nI Am Trying to Break Your Heart at IMDb\nI Am Trying to Break Your Heart at BoxOfficeMojo","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/e\/e7\/I-am-trying-to-break-your-heart.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/99\/Question_book-new.svg"],"links":["A.M.

Tweedy, originally from Belleville, Illinois, started his music career in high school in his band The Plebes with Jay Farrar, which subsequently transitioned into the alternative country band Uncle Tupelo. After Uncle Tupelo broke up, Tweedy formed Wilco which found critical and commercial success, most notably with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born, the latter of which received a Grammy for Best Alternative Album in 2005.\nAcross his career Tweedy has released 20 studio albums, including four with Uncle Tupelo, twelve with Wilco, one with his son Spencer, a solo acoustic album, three solo studio albums, along with numerous collaborations with other musicians, most notably Mermaid Avenue with Billy Bragg.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTweedy was born in Belleville, Illinois, on August 25, 1967, the fourth child of Bob and JoAnn Tweedy (n\u00e9e Werkmeister). Bob Tweedy (died August 4, 2017) worked at Alton & Southern Railroad in East St. Louis while JoAnn was a kitchen designer.:\u200a11\u201315\u200a Tweedy has three siblings: older brother Greg Tweedy (died in 2013), brother Steven Tweedy, and sister Debbie Voll.Tweedy's mother bought him his first guitar when he was six years old, although he did not begin to play it seriously until he was twelve. Apparently Tweedy told people that he knew how to play the guitar once he got his first guitar, even though he couldn't. When he was twelve, Tweedy was injured in a bicycle accident and was laid up for the summer. He decided to learn how to play a few chords before somebody \"called him out\" on the lie. In 1981, when Tweedy was fourteen years old, he befriended Jay Farrar in an English class at Belleville Township High School West.:\u200a10\u200a All of the members of Farrar's family enjoyed playing music, so Farrar already had knowledge of the musical elements of rock and roll. By this time, Tweedy was a fan of The Ramones and country music while Farrar enjoyed The Sex Pistols.Tweedy attended Belleville Area College and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early music ===\nIn the early 1980s, Tweedy joined a rockabilly band called The Plebes with brothers Wade and Dade Farrar, which Tweedy joined in order to qualify for a battle of the bands competition, which they won.:\u200a10,\u200a17\u200a Tweedy pushed The Plebes away from the rockabilly music that they had been playing, which caused Dade Farrar to leave the band. The band renamed themselves The Primitives in 1984, taking their name from a song by garage rock band The Groupies.:\u200a18\u200a Wade Farrar sang lead vocals and played harmonica, Jay Farrar played guitar, Tweedy played bass guitar, and Mike Heidorn played drums. In late 1986, the band decided to change their name to Uncle Tupelo, because a more popular British band was also using the name \"The Primitives\". The Primitives went on hiatus in 1986 after Wade Farrar left the band to finish his engineering degree at Southern Illinois University.:\u200a22\u200a While waiting for Wade to return from campus, Farrar, Tweedy, and Heidorn formed Uncle Tupelo.\n\n\n=== Uncle Tupelo (1987\u20131994) ===\n\nAt his parents' request, Tweedy enrolled at several universities, but dropped out of them so that he could concentrate on Uncle Tupelo. While moonlighting as a record store clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis, Tweedy met Tony Margherita. After Margherita saw the band perform at an acoustic concert in 1988, he decided to become the band's manager. The band began playing regular shows at Cicero's basement bar in the Delmar Loop near Washington University in St. Louis with other bands playing in a similar style.:\u200a24\u201326\u200a Uncle Tupelo recorded a ten-track demo tape entitled Not Forever, Just For Now in 1989, attracting the attention of Giant\/Rockville Records. The independent label signed the band, and Uncle Tupelo's first album, No Depression, was released the next year. The title song, originally performed by the Carter Family, became strongly associated with the alternative country scene, and became the name of an influential alternative country periodical called No Depression.\nDuring times when Uncle Tupelo was not touring, Tweedy and Farrar played as Coffee Creek, a short-lived cover band with The Bottle Rockets' Brian Henneman and Mark Ortmann. Around this time, Tweedy began developing problems with alcohol, leading to tensions between Tweedy and Farrar. While he never refused to play a gig, Tweedy was forced to sit out in place of Henneman at some performances. Tweedy quit drinking entirely after meeting future wife Sue Miller, although he replaced this habit with smoking marijuana. However, after developing a dependence on marijuana, he quickly quit using it, as well.:\u200a51\u201353,\u200a95\u200a After releasing Still Feel Gone, the band formed a friendship with Peter Buck of R.E.M., who produced their third album March 16\u201320, 1992 for free. Uncle Tupelo left the Rockville label in favor of Sire Records (Warner) later in 1992 because Rockville refused to pay the band any royalties for their albums.:\u200a72\u200a After the signing, Max Johnston and John Stirratt joined the band as Mike Heidorn was replaced by Bill Belzer who was later replaced by Ken Coomer.:\u200a74\u201375\u200a The five-piece band recorded Anodyne, which sold over 150,000 copies and debuted at number 18 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, but was the last album Uncle Tupelo released.:\u200a80\u200a\n\n\n==== Breakup ====\nIn January 1994, Farrar called Tony Margherita to tell him that the band was breaking up, saying that he was not having any fun in the band anymore and was not getting along with Tweedy. Tweedy was enraged that Farrar decided to break up the band without notifying him, and this led to a series of harsh verbal exchanges. Farrar and Tweedy agreed to a final Uncle Tupelo tour, but the concerts were marred by the two not participating in each other's songs. The band decided to play Tweedy's \"The Long Cut\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which further distanced Farrar and Tweedy.:\u200a80\u201384\u200a Farrar began to assemble a new band named Son Volt with Mike Heidorn, bassist Jim Boquist, and his brother Dave Boquist. At the same time, Jeff Tweedy formed Wilco with Stirratt, Johnston, and Coomer.:\u200a88,\u200a90\u200a\n\n\n=== Wilco (1995\u2013present) ===\n\nIn 1994, Tweedy formed Wilco with John Stirratt, Max Johnston, and Ken Coomer. Wilco has released twelve albums and found commercial success with their albums Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born, Sky Blue Sky and Wilco. The band also released two collaboration albums with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5. Jeff Tweedy has been the recipient of two Grammy Awards, including Best Alternative Album for A Ghost Is Born. Tweedy has also participated in a number of side groups including Golden Smog and Loose Fur, published a book of poems, and released a DVD of solo performances. He was originally influenced by punk and country music, but has later reflected more experimental themes in his music.\n\nWilco signed with Reprise\/Warner Bros. Records and began recording AM almost as soon as the band was formed.:\u200a89\u201391\u200a After recording, Tweedy was introduced to Jay Bennett, who then joined the band. Also during this time, Tweedy quit smoking marijuana after a particularly bad experience with some cannabis brownies.:\u200a94\u201396\u200a A.M. did not fare as well commercially in comparison to Son Volt's first album, only reaching number 27 on the Heatseekers chart while Son Volt's debut Trace hit the Billboard 200. Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum invited Tweedy to join him in a supergroup named Golden Smog with Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run, and Noah Levy of The Honeydogs. Under the pseudonym Scott Summit, Tweedy released Down by the Old Mainstream with Golden Smog in 1996.:\u200a105\u2013106\u200aTweedy and Wilco began to explore new styles and broke from the style of previous recordings on the seminal sprawling double album Being There in 1996. Tweedy did not write music for many of the songs ahead of time, and welcomed unexpected sounds into the recording. Wilco recorded nineteen songs for the double-CD album, and wanted the label to release it with a retail price comparable to a single-CD release.:\u200a113,\u200a116\u200a Being There was a commercial success, selling 300,000 copies and peaking in the top half of the Billboard 200. Reprise records invested $100,000 in the single \"Outta Mind (Outtasite)\", but received little radio exposure.:\u200a125\u200a While on tour, Tweedy began to spend time reading books by William H. Gass, Henry Miller, and John Fante. As he read their books, Tweedy decided to place more of an emphasis on writing.:\u200a136\u200a Representatives in the A&R department of Reprise wanted a radio single from Summerteeth, and Wilco reluctantly agreed to a re-working of \"Can't Stand It\". The single was a top five hit on adult album alternative radio stations, but failed to cross over to a larger audience.:\u200a162\u2013167\u200aBefore the release of Summerteeth, the daughter of the late folk legend Woody Guthrie contacted folk rock singer Billy Bragg, who in turn contacted Tweedy about recording an album of unreleased Woody Guthrie songs. Tweedy was indifferent to the idea of working with Bragg, but Jay Bennett's enthusiasm about the idea convinced Tweedy to get the band involved in the project. As a result of Tweedy's feelings on the political nature of some of the lyrics, Bragg recorded mostly political songs while Wilco recorded more neutral songs. Almost all of the songs that appeared on Mermaid Avenue and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II were recorded over a six-day period in December 1997.:\u200a142\u2013145\u200a The first Mermaid Avenue album and a second Golden Smog album (Weird Tales) were released in 1998, Summerteeth was released in early 1999, and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II was released in 2000. Tweedy received his first Grammy nomination when Mermaid Avenue was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 1999.\n\n\n==== Yankee Hotel Foxtrot ====\nJeff Tweedy was invited to play at Chicago's Noise Pop festival, and was told that he could collaborate with a musician of his choosing. Tweedy chose Jim O'Rourke based on his fascination with O'Rourke's Bad Timing album. O'Rourke offered to bring drummer Glenn Kotche to the festival, and the trio formed a side project named Loose Fur. The other band members of Wilco had written a number of songs for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but Tweedy was unsatisfied with them because he believed that the songs did not sound like the ones he played with Loose Fur. Tweedy became such a fan of Kotche's playing style that he decided to dismiss Ken Coomer from the band in favor of Kotche.:\u200a176\u2013183,\u200a188\u200a Tweedy had strong feelings about how songs should be sequenced, which clashed with Jay Bennett's focus on the songs themselves. Because Bennett was mixing the album, this led to a series of arguments between songs about how the album should sound. Tweedy asked O'Rourke to remix several songs on the album that had been mixed by Bennett, which caused tensions within the band to escalate. The album was completed in June 2001, and Tweedy was insistent that it was in its final form.:\u200a197\u2013200\u200a Tweedy also fired Bennett around this time, believing (according to Bennett) that Wilco should only have one core member. The band maintains that the firing of Bennett was a collective decision.Reprise Records' parent company Time Warner merged with America Online in 2001, and the recording company was asked to cut costs. Howie Klein, the CEO of Reprise Records, considered Wilco to be one of the label's core bands, but was offered a lucrative buy-out by AOL Time Warner. Reprise did not consider the album commercially viable and was not interested in releasing the album. David Kahne (Head of A&R) agreed to release Wilco from Reprise under the condition that Wilco got to keep all legal entitlements to the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album.:\u200a201\u2013207\u200a After an article in the Chicago Tribune publicly described these managerial practices, CEO Gary Briggs quit.:\u200a208\u2013209\u200a Shortly after leaving the label, Briggs remarked:\n\nIt [dropping Wilco from the label] should never have happened. One of the most embarrassing moments in my career at Warner Brothers was the day they let Wilco go. It broke my heart, and it told me that I no longer have a home there.:\u200a208\u2013209\u200a\nYankee Hotel Foxtrot was originally scheduled to be released on Reprise on September 11, 2001, prior to the band's departure from Reprise. Seven days later, Tweedy decided that he would stream the entirety of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on Wilco's official website.:\u200a225\u200a Over thirty record labels offered to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot after the departure from Reprise was official. One of the thirty was Warner Brothers affiliate Nonesuch Records, who signed Wilco in November 2001. AOL Time Warner paid Wilco to make the album on Reprise, gave them the record for free, and then bought it back on the Nonesuch label.:\u200a209\u2013210\u200a The album was released on April 23, 2002 to significant critical acclaim, including being named the best album of the year by The Village Voice. The album became the biggest hit of Jeff Tweedy's career and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 500,000 copies.\n\n\n==== A Ghost Is Born ====\nScott McCaughey contacted Tweedy about recording an album together for a The Minus 5 release. They scheduled a meeting for September 11, 2001, but were reluctant to enter the recording studio after the terrorist attacks. At night, McCaughey and Tweedy decided to begin recording songs as a way to calm down. A few more tracks were later added to the album with the rest of Wilco, and it was released with the name Down with Wilco in 2003.:\u200a220\u2013222\u200aIn November 2003, Wilco began recording a fifth studio album. Unlike their previous albums, all of the songs were originally performed in the studio and then later adapted for playing at concerts. Wilco released A Ghost Is Born on June 22, 2004, and it attained a top ten peak on the Billboard 200. The album was awarded with Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. A few weeks before the album's release, Tweedy released a book of forty-three poems entitled Adult Head on Zoo Press. The following year, the band released their first live album, a two-disc set entitled Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, recorded at The Vic Theater.\n\n\n==== Subsequent Wilco albums ====\nWilco recorded twelve tracks for a sixth studio album entitled Sky Blue Sky, which was released on May 15, 2007. Sky Blue Sky debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, the band's highest debut yet. It sold over 87,000 copies in its first week of release.In early May 2009, former Wilco member Jay Bennett sued Tweedy for breach of contract. Bennett died later that month of an apparent accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl. In June 2009 Wilco released their seventh studio album Wilco (The Album), followed by The Whole Love in 2011, Star Wars in 2015, Schmilco in 2016 and Ode to Joy in 2019. Wilco's latest album Cruel Country appeared in May 2022.\n\n\n=== Other work ===\nJeff Tweedy has performed several solo tours, on which he typically plays acoustic music.  He also recorded the song \"Simple Twist of Fate\" for the soundtrack to I'm Not There. On October 24, 2006, Nonesuch Records released Sunken Treasure: Live in the Pacific Northwest, a live DVD by Tweedy. The disc includes performances and conversations gathered over five nights on Tweedy's February 2006 solo acoustic tour, with footage from concerts at Seattle's Moore Theater, Portland's Crystal Ballroom, Eugene's McDonald Theatre, Arcata's Humboldt State University, and The Fillmore in San Francisco. The DVD was directed by Christoph Green and Fugazi's Brendan Canty, the creators of the documentary series Burn to Shine.Tweedy has partnered with Mavis Staples on three acclaimed albums. In 2010 they released You Are Not Alone, in 2013, One True Vine, and in 2017 If All I Was Was Black. Tweedy played an array of instruments on these albums and wrote many of the songs.Tweedy worked with the psychedelic-influenced garage rock group White Denim on their record Corsicana Lemonade, recording some songs at Wilco's Chicago studio The Loft. In 2015 the album Still by Richard Thompson was released. The album was produced by Tweedy in The Loft Studios and features Tweedy on guitar and backing vocals.Tweedy has appeared as a fictional singer-songwriter on 2014 episodes of Parks and Recreation and Portlandia.On June 4, 2014, it was announced that he had formed a new band called Tweedy with his son Spencer. The band's debut album Sukierae was released on September 16. The release was followed by a world tour in which half of the set consisted of new songs off Sukierae performed by a touring band including Spencer. The latter half of the set Tweedy plays solo, typically performing Wilco and Uncle Tupelo classics.In June 2017 Jeff Tweedy released a solo acoustic album of eleven songs spanning his career from Wilco, Loose Fur, and Golden Smog titled Together at Last. In November 2018 Jeff Tweedy released a memoir titled Let's Go (So We Can Get Back) and his first solo album of new material, titled Warm. A companion album to Warm titled Warmer was released on April 13, 2019, as a Record Store Day exclusive.In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic Susan Tweedy and her family created a recurring video series on Instagram dubbed The Tweedy Show featuring Jeff and their sons performing original and cover songs. During the shelter-in-place Jeff Tweedy also wrote and recorded his third solo album titled Love Is the King which was announced to release on October 23, 2020 and wrote his second book titled How to Write One Song which was announced to release on October 13, 2020, on the E. P. Dutton publishing label. His third book, World Within a Song, will be released in November 2023.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nTweedy's musical style has varied over his music career. Tweedy's vocal style is considered nasal, emotional, and raspy, and has been compared to that of Neil Young. His first exposure to music was through gramophone records that his siblings left behind when they attended college, and he particularly liked The Beatles' White Album. Tweedy would frequently read issues of magazines such as Rolling Stone, and began to purchase punk rock albums such as The Clash's London Calling and X's Wild Gift. Belleville crowds did not respond well to punk music, so while Tweedy was a member of The Primitives they played covers of country songs at much faster tempos.:\u200a13\u201319\u200a  When Uncle Tupelo formed, the band began composing its own songs influenced by Jason & the Scorchers and The Minutemen. Wilco's first album shared many musical similarities with the four previous Uncle Tupelo albums, but on Being There, Tweedy began introducing more experimental themes into his music. He claims that he wanted to rebel against the belief spread by the No Depression magazine that Wilco was primarily a country band.:\u200a110\u2013111\u200a One of the most influential albums for Tweedy was Bad Timing by Jim O'Rourke, which helped to inspire Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born.:\u200a176\u2013177\u200a Tweedy uses a 1957 Gibson J-45 acoustic guitar, as well as a 1965 Fender Jazzmaster, at least three different Telecasters, an Epiphone Casino, a Rickenbacker 360, and a Gibson SG Standard. He has vintage SGs from '62 and '65 as well as a 2007 Custom Shop model and a 2008 Custom Shop Vintage Original Spec (V.O.S.) that are all rigged with Maestro tremolo bars. He also has been known to use a Breedlove 000 and even designed a limited edition 000 for Breedlove in 2007. His amplifier of choice is a Vox AC30.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nTweedy has been prone to migraines throughout his entire life, forcing him to miss forty days of elementary school in one year.:\u200a50\u200a While he attempted to regulate his use of painkillers, he was never able to stop their use for more than five weeks. Tweedy attributes this to comorbidity with major depressive disorder and severe panic attacks. In 2004, he entered a dual diagnosis rehabilitation clinic in order to receive treatment for an addiction to prescription painkiller Vicodin. Tweedy quit smoking the next year; John Stirratt claimed afterward that this significantly improved the focus of the band.Tweedy is married to former talent agent Sue Miller and lives in the Irving Park area of Chicago. Tweedy first met Miller when he was trying to get Uncle Tupelo booked at Cubby Bear, where Miller worked. Miller opened a club in Chicago named Lounge Ax in 1989, and booked Uncle Tupelo for 16 shows over four years. Miller and Tweedy began dating in 1991 and they were married on August 9, 1995.:\u200a53,\u200a96\u200a Sue was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Tweedy said \"she's doing great now.\" Tweedy also said that music is a healthy distraction in such difficult times. They have two sons: Spencer and Sam. Spencer was the drummer for pre-teen rock band The Blisters and a new band called Tully Monster. In 2008, Spencer joined Wilco on stage at Madison Square Garden to play drums on their song \"The Late Greats,\" while opening for Neil Young.Tweedy has converted to Judaism. His wife is Jewish, and their sons both had Bar Mitzvah ceremonies. During the ceremony for his older son, Tweedy played an acoustic version of Bob Dylan's \"Forever Young\".In November 2019 Tweedy's home in Irving Park was shot at least seven times in an attack described by his son as \"not targeted\". No injuries were reported.\n\n\n== Selected discography ==\n\n\n=== Solo ===\nTogether at Last (2017)\nWarm (2018)\nWarmer (2019)\nLove Is the King (2020)\n\n\n=== With Uncle Tupelo ===\nNo Depression (1990)\nStill Feel Gone (1991)\nMarch 16\u201320, 1992 (1992)\nAnodyne (1993)\n\n\n=== With Wilco ===\nA.M.

The album consists of material from four live shows at Chicago's Vic Theater recorded May 4, 2005 to May 7, 2005. Although the band filmed the concerts, they decided not to release the footage as a DVD. It was the band's first album with an expanded lineup featuring Nels Cline and Pat Sansone.\nKicking Television debuted on the Billboard 200 at number forty-seven, and has since sold over 114,000 copies. Critical reception to the album was generally positive. Publications such as The A.V. Club and Pitchfork lauded the band's performance of material from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born.\nOn April 17, 2010, for Record Store Day Wilco released an audiophile, 180-gram vinyl pressing of Kicking Television. The vinyl pressing, spread across four LP's, included eight previously unreleased tracks recorded in May 2005.\n\n\n== Production ==\nShortly after the release of A Ghost Is Born, Wilco's fifth studio album, multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band to pursue a career in theater production. To replace him, the band added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to their lineup. The lineup was expanded because lead singer Jeff Tweedy was concerned that the other members were multi-tasking on instruments. This made performing material live from Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot difficult. While touring in support of Ghost, Wilco decided to record their first live album.Wilco decided to use concerts from their hometown of Chicago \"because [they] wanted to be really comfortable\". They chose a string of four consecutive shows from May 4 to May 7, 2005, at The Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois. The band recorded the four shows on a 24-track digital recorder. The shows were filmed for a potential DVD release, but the band decided not to release the footage. According to Tweedy, the band was disappointed by how the footage \"sapped\" the energy out of the performances. On September 13, 2005, the band announced that the album would be released on November 1, 2005. The release date was later delayed two weeks.Most of the material from the album\u201416 of 23 songs\u2014is from Wilco's two Nonesuch Records releases: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born. The title track was an outtake from the Ghost recording sessions because the band considered it to be one of their most exciting songs live. Tweedy explained why it was chosen for the title:\nA rock concert is \"kicking television.\" If you're out of the house and with a bunch of people enjoying something together, that's kicking television to me. I don't think very many people, myself included, will ever kick television cold turkey, but I certainly think more people should be aware of what it's doing to them.\nTwo live tracks from Summerteeth were also included on the album, as well as one song each from Being There, Mermaid Avenue and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. The final track was a cover of \"Comment (If All Men Are Truly Brothers)\", originally performed by Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band.Guitarist Jeff Tweedy provided the lead vocals for the album and John Stirratt, the only other original member of the band, played bass guitar and added backing vocals. Lead guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone performed here on a Wilco album for the first time. Glenn Kotche performed on the drums and other percussion instruments, and Mikael Jorgensen played keyboards. Other instrumentation was provided by Patrick Newbery (trumpet and flugelhorn), Nick Broste (trombone), and Rick Parenti (baritone sax).\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nNonesuch Records released the album on November 15, 2005. The album debuted at number forty-seven on the U.S. Billboard 200 and spent two weeks on the chart. As of April 13, 2007, the album had sold over 114,000 copies.\nKicking Television was well received by critics; according to Metacritic, it was given a score of 85 out of 100 based on \"universal acclaim\". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club called the album \"stellar\" and expressed surprise over how well the A Ghost Is Born songs sounded live. AllMusic editor Mark Deming lauded the \"new muscle and force\" of the songs, and commented on \"the \u00e9lan of this band in full flight shows,\" declaring that \"the fun has been put back in Wilco.\" Marc Hogan of Pitchfork called the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot songs \"still awesome\" and remarked that \"this is what A Ghost Is Born is supposed to sound like.\" Q said that \"Live albums rarely come equipped with such a strong pulse\" and later named the album one of the top 20 live albums of all time.E! Online said that Wilco \"[turn] each song up to 11 and [let their] rabid hometown fans provide thousand-strong backing vocals. It'll make you want to yell 'Woooh!' too.\" Spin stated: \"Not since Grateful Dead's Europe '72 has there been a live double album in which intimacy and expansiveness, guitar mess and piano reflection commingle this sweetly.\" Billboard said that Wilco had \"never sounded better\". Ben Gilbert of Yahoo! Music UK stated that the album \"documents a band on fire and a frontman in clarion clear voice.\" Under the Radar said the album \"Captures a band at the height of their creative powers.\" Uncut said, \"In this live setting, fascinatingly, the brutality to which the songs are subjected only serves to underscore their poignancy.\" Blender said it \"sounds like a greatest hits set.\"Although most reviews applauded the effort, critics also expressed discontent with elements of the album. Hogan noted in his Pitchfork review that Tweedy's banter was \"ho-hum\", and stated that \"Kicking Television\" and \"The Late Greats\" should have been cut from the album. Andrew Gaering of Stylus Magazine gave the album a B rating, but was disappointed with how the songs \"find the band holding serve\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs were written by Jeff Tweedy, except where noted.\n\n\n=== Disc one ===\n\"Misunderstood\" \u2013 6:08 (from Being There)\n\"Company in My Back\" \u2013 3:44 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"The Late Greats\" \u2013 2:40 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Hell Is Chrome\" (Mikael Jorgensen, Tweedy) \u2013 4:56 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Handshake Drugs\" \u2013 6:23 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\" \u2013 6:03 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"A Shot in the Arm\" (Jay Bennett, John Stirratt, Tweedy) \u2013 4:51 (from Summerteeth)\n\"At Least That's What You Said\" \u2013 5:18 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Wishful Thinking\" (Glenn Kotche, Tweedy) \u2013 4:26 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Jesus, Etc.\" (Bennett, Tweedy) \u2013 4:00 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\" (Bennett, Tweedy) \u2013 3:58 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"Kicking Television\" \u2013 3:03 (B-Side of \"I'm a Wheel\")\n\n\n=== Disc two ===\n\"Via Chicago\" \u2013 5:14 (from Summerteeth)\n\"Hummingbird\" \u2013 3:19 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Muzzle of Bees\" \u2013 4:49 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"One by One\" (Woody Guthrie, Tweedy) \u2013 3:26 (from Mermaid Avenue)\n\"Airline to Heaven\" (Bennett, Guthrie, Tweedy) \u2013 4:41 (from Mermaid Avenue Vol. II)\n\"Radio Cure\" (Bennett, Tweedy) \u2013 4:42 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"Ashes of American Flags\" (Bennett, Tweedy) \u2013 6:03 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"Heavy Metal Drummer\" \u2013 3:21 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"Poor Places\" (Bennett, Tweedy) \u2013 5:31 (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"Spiders (Kidsmoke)\" \u2013 11:17 (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Comment\" (Yusef Rahman, Charles Wright) \u2013 6:13 (previously unreleased)\n\n\n=== Vinyl bonus tracks ===\n\"Another Man's Done Gone\" (Guthrie, Bragg) (from Mermaid Avenue)\n\"How to Fight Loneliness\" (Tweedy, Bennett) (from Summerteeth)\n\"Theologians\" (Tweedy, Jorgensen, Chris Girard) (from A Ghost Is Born)\n\"Kamera\" (Tweedy, Bennett) (from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot)\n\"Just a Kid\" (Jeff Tweedy, Spencer Tweedy) (from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie: Music From the Movie and More)\n\"Monday\" (from Being There)\n\"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\" (from Being There)\n\"I'm a Wheel\" (from A Ghost Is Born)\"How to Fight Loneliness\" (from Summerteeth) and \"Monday\" (from Being There) were included with purchase of the album on iTunes.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAll information is taken from the liner notes of Kicking Television.\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 vocals, guitar\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 drums, percussion\nNels Cline \u2013 guitar, lap steel guitar\nPat Sansone \u2013 guitar, keyboards, backing vocals\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 keyboards\nPatrick Newbery \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn\nNick Broste \u2013 trombone\nRick Parenti \u2013 baritone sax\nKarina Benznicki \u2013 production supervisor\nEli Cane \u2013 production coordination\nMycle Konopka, Timothy Powell \u2013 engineers\nNick Webb \u2013 mastering\nStan Doty, Jim Scott \u2013 mixing\nDan Glomski, Michael Ways \u2013 assistants\nChris Hoffman, Deborah Miles Johnson, Frankie Montuoro, Matt Zivich \u2013 technical crew\nNathan Baker \u2013 photography, technical crew\nZoran Orlic, Mike Segal \u2013 photography\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKicking Television: Live in Chicago at Metacritic","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Star_empty.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/51\/Star_full.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/81\/Star_half.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/0f\/Wilco.jpg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/9\/94\/Symbol_support_vote.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/0\/02\/WilcoKickingTelevision.jpg"],"links":["A.M.

All songs on the original album consisted of Bragg singing to his electric guitar accompaniment.\nThe original album played at 45 rpm rather than the more usual 33\u2153 rpm, contained only seven songs and lasted for only 15 minutes and 57 seconds. However, rather than being classified as an EP, it qualified for the UK Albums Chart and reached number 30 in January 1984.The album contains both politically charged songs, such as the attack on the school system and unemployment, \"To Have and to Have Not\", and love songs such as \"The Milkman of Human Kindness\" and \"A New England\" (which was later a hit for singer Kirsty MacColl).\nThe title of the album alludes to Bragg's pseudonym of Spy vs Spy which he used when busking prior to his recording career, and which in turn comes from the strip of the same name in Mad magazine.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIt was ranked at number 3 among the \"Albums of the Year\" for 1983 by NME; thirty years later, the magazine ranked it at number 440 in its list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".Spin wrote the album would, \"probably fully launch Bragg on the already friendly seas of college radio, and maybe beyond. It deserves a listen, but it's not going to spearhead any 'folk revival' you've read about yesterday or three years ago.\"\n\n\n== Versions ==\nThe album was originally released by Utility Records through Chrysalis in May 1983. The cassette version of the album was recorded on only one side of the tape; the second side of the tape was blank, inscribed with a message that fans should use it to bootleg his concerts. The album was then reissued in November 1983 on Go! Discs. In 1986 the tracks from the album along with the tracks from Brewing Up with Billy Bragg (1984) and the tracks from the Between the Wars EP (1985) were issued on a compilation album called Back to Basics by Go! Discs. This compilation was reissued by Cooking Vinyl in 1996. Cooking Vinyl released another compilation album in 1996 combining the tracks from the album with the four tracks from the Between the Wars EP and titled Life's a Riot Between the Wars.[1]\nIn 2006 as part of a series of reissues of albums from his back catalogue, the album was reissued as Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy, with the original tracks on one disc along with a bonus CD of alternative versions and previously unreleased material. The tracks on the bonus CD were produced and compiled by Grant Showbiz.\nIn October 2013, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original release, a new version was released. This featured a remastered version of the original tracks alongside a live performance of the album which was recorded live at the Union Chapel, London on 5 June 2013.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Billy Bragg, except where noted\n\n\"The Milkman of Human Kindness\" \u2013 2:49\n\"To Have and to Have Not\" \u2013 2:33\n\"Richard\" \u2013 2:51\n\"A New England\" \u2013 2:14\n\"The Man in the Iron Mask\" \u2013 2:13\n\"The Busy Girl Buys Beauty\" \u2013 1:58\n\"Lovers Town Revisited\" \u2013 1:19Additional tracks on 2006 reissue\n\n\"Strange Things Happen\" (alternative version) \u2013 3:19\n\"The Cloth I\" \u2013 2:50\n\"Love Lives Here\" \u2013 1:42\n\"Speedway Hero\" \u2013 2:39\n\"Loving You Too Long\" \u2013 2:51\n\"The Guitar Says Sorry\" (alternative version) \u2013 2:14\n\"Love Gets Dangerous\" (alternative version) \u2013 2:32\n\"The Cloth II\" \u2013 2:47\n\"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (alternative version) \u2013 2:17\n\"A13, Trunk Road to the Sea\" (music by Bobby Troup, words by Bragg) \u2013 2:27\n\"Fear Is a Man's Best Friend\" (John Cale) \u2013 2:32Additional tracks (live) on 2013 reissue\n\n\"Intro\"\n\"Lovers Town Revisited\"\n\"To Have and to Have Not\"\n\"The Busy Girl Buys Beauty\"\n\"The Man in the Iron Mask\"\n\"Richard\"\n\"The Milkman of Human Kindness\"\n\"A New England\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\nBilly Bragg \u2013 vocals, guitar\nDave Woodhead \u2013 trumpet on \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" (alternative version)\n\n\n=== Production ===\nOliver Hitch \u2013 producer, engineer, recorded by (original album plus \"The Guitar Says Sorry\" (alternative version), \"Love Gets Dangerous\" (alternative version), \"The Cloth II\", \"A13, Trunk Road to the Sea\", \"Fear Is a Man's Best Friend\")\nGrant Showbiz \u2013 reissue producer, reissue compiled by\nTim Young \u2013 digitally remastered by (original album tracks)\nDuncan Cowell \u2013 digitally remastered by (bonus tracks)\nSteve Goldstein \u2013 recorded by (\"Strange Things Happen\" (alternative version), \"The Cloth I\", \"Love Lives Here\")\nWiggy \u2013 recorded by (\"Speedway Hero\", \"Loving You too Long\")\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nCollins, Andrew (2018).

The trio first convened in May 2000 in preparation for a Tweedy performance at a festival in Chicago. Tweedy was offered the opportunity to collaborate with an artist of his choosing, and he decided to work with O'Rourke. O'Rourke brought Kotche to a rehearsal session, and the trio recorded an album's worth of songs. The trio have since released two albums, 2003's Loose Fur and 2006's Born Again in the USA, for Drag City. The band has only toured once.\nThe band is noted for its influence on Wilco's fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Tweedy was unhappy with how music from the initial recording sessions for the album was sounding, resulting in a lineup change for the band. Both O'Rourke and Kotche replaced members of Wilco during the recording sessions for the album, and both contributed to the band's recordings through 2007's Sky Blue Sky. Kotche remains a member of Wilco as of 2023.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nIn the winter of 1999, Wilco lead singer Jeff Tweedy acquired a copy of Jim O'Rourke's 1997 album Bad Timing. The album featured four instrumental tracks that juxtaposed guitar parts with orchestration. Tweedy liked how O'Rourke's music was varied and \"not easily categorized\". According to Tweedy:\n[Bad Timing] ended up blowing my mind more than just about any album I'd heard in the last five years\nTweedy was invited to perform with a collaborator of his choice for the 2000 Noise Pop Festival in Chicago. The festival promoter offered to pair him with members of the Mekons, but Tweedy decided to collaborate with O'Rourke. The pair met at O'Rourke's apartment a few days before the festival. They listened to gramophone records by T. Rex, Phil Niblock, and Roy Harper; later that night they wrote material for the concert and agreed to meet the next day at the Wilco loft in Chicago. O'Rourke invited Glenn Kotche, a drummer who played in a similar musical style, to the practice session. Tweedy found lyrical inspiration from word exercises; for example, he picked out random words from a copy of TV Guide and formed abstract lines such as \"you boil hearts and discuss birds\". He also sought to improve as a guitarist, taking influence from free jazz artists such as James \"Blood\" Ulmer.On May 14, 2000, Jeff Tweedy played the Noise Pop Festival at Double Door in a concert that polarized Wilco fans. Natalie Merchant joined the band onstage, but left after Tweedy requested that she perform Utah Phillips' murder ballad \"Rock Salt and Nails\". Among the new material performed at the concert was \"Laminated Cat\", a reworked version of a  Wilco demo entitled \"Not for the Season\"\u2014Tweedy was unhappy with the straightforwardness of Wilco's version. The trio decided to name their band Loose Fur and recorded a six-song album in the summer of 2000. The band also made an uncredited appearance on O'Rourke's 2001 solo album Insignificance. The Loose Fur album was not released at the time because Tweedy was busy recording Wilco's fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\n\n\n== Influence on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot ==\n\nBy winter 2000, Wilco had completed enough material for an album release. However, Tweedy was dissatisfied with the \"emotional center\" of the recordings. He wanted the release to sound more like the music he had recorded with Loose Fur, although he \"couldn't put his finger on why.\" Tweedy wanted the album to advance the sound of Wilco in a similar fashion as Being There and Summerteeth. He became irritated by Wilco drummer Ken Coomer because Coomer disliked playing consistent drum patterns each time that the band played a song. Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett also soured on Coomer because of the drummer's lack of patience and consistency. Although he briefly considered adding Kotche as a secondary percussionist, Tweedy decided to replace Coomer with his Loose Fur bandmate:\nPlaying solo shows, playing with Glenn, playing in Loose Fur made me realize how important it was to have Wilco feel like those experiences. I played this whole show in December with a drummer who theoretically didn't know any of the material, and it felt more fluid and exciting than 90 percent of the shows I'd done in the last three or four years. That was too much information to ignore. I became certain that this is how music is supposed to feel, and I got braver about doing something about it.\nKotche re-wrote the drum parts for the album almost immediately upon his acceptance into the band. In one instance, he reworked \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\" by adding parts played on hubcaps, crotales, and floor tiles. Although some members were unsure about the decision to replace Coomer with Kotche, the band unanimously supported the decision after hearing Kotche's new percussion parts. According to Bennett:\nGlenn made the songs happen. He could do what was asked of him and brought good ideas to the table. He's an extramusical drummer\u2014not more or less talented than Ken, but certainly different in the kinds of things he was able to bring to the songs. After that, no one could curse Jeff for sponsoring this great musician into the band. It was the right decision.\nCoomer wasn't the only band member that struck a nerve with Tweedy during the recording sessions. Tweedy was unhappy with the way that Bennett mixed parts of the album, particularly the sequences between songs. Tweedy felt that Bennett was \"burning out\" while mixing the album, and invited Jim O'Rourke to remix \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\". Although Bennett conceded that O'Rourke did a better job of mixing the song, animosity arose between the two engineers. O'Rourke continued to remix more songs, and attempted to increase the drama of the album by reducing the contributions by the backing members of Wilco. He removed so many parts on some songs that only music by Tweedy, Kotche, and himself\u2014the three members of Loose Fur\u2014appeared on those pieces.\n\n\n== Recording career ==\nOn January 28, 2003, Loose Fur released the six-track album that they recorded at the Wilco loft in 2000. Unlike Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Loose Fur featured only one overdub per song. The band played two shows in Brooklyn, NY in support of the album, playing their first live show as \"Loose Fur\" on December 6, 2002.In October 2005, Tweedy announced that the band was nearly finished recording their second Loose Fur album. The album, Born Again in the USA, was the first album to consist mostly of O'Rourke lyrics since Insignificance. Unlike their first album, Loose Fur did not tour to support the album. In contrast to their eponymous debut, Born Again in the USA was heavier with more harmonized guitar parts. Both of their albums were received favorably by critics. Tweedy performed \"The Ruling Class\" and \"Laminated Cat\" on a solo performance DVD in 2005. Glenn Kotche is still the drummer for Wilco, and Jim O'Rourke is a regular collaborator with the band; both performed on A Ghost Is Born and Sky Blue Sky. In a 2016 interview, Jeff Tweedy confirmed that the band has already recorded a followup to Born Again In The USA, but that the recordings had not yet undergone post-production.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKot, Greg (2004).

Bragg invited American band Wilco to back him on the recordings, and Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett from the band wrote music for additional Guthrie lyrics.\nThroughout the film, Nora narrates the story of her father's life, while Bragg is seen traveling to various locations relevant to Woody Guthrie's life, such as Okemah, Oklahoma (his hometown), Pampa, Texas (where he met his first wife), and New York City (where he made his home after leaving California).

The project was the first of several such projects organized by Guthrie's daughter, Nora Guthrie, original director of the Woody Guthrie Foundation and archives. Mermaid Avenue was released on the Elektra Records label on June 23, 1998. A second volume of recordings, Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, followed in 2000 and both were collected in a box set alongside volume three in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions. The projects are named after the song \"Mermaid's Avenue\", written by Guthrie. This was also the name of the street in Coney Island, New York, on which Guthrie lived. According to American Songwriter Magazine, \"The Mermaid Avenue project is essential for showing that Woody Guthrie could illuminate what was going on inside of him as well as he could detail the plight of his fellow man\". It was voted number 939 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\n\n== Recording ==\nDuring the spring of 1995, Woody Guthrie's daughter Nora contacted English singer-songwriter Billy Bragg about writing music for a selection of completed Guthrie lyrics after Bragg played a Guthrie tribute concert in New York City's Central Park. Her father had left behind over a thousand sets of complete lyrics written between 1939 and 1967; as they had not been recorded by Guthrie, and he did not write music, none of these lyrics had any music other than a vague stylistic notation.\nNora Guthrie's liner notes in Mermaid Avenue indicate that it was her intention that the songs be given to a new generation of musicians who would be able to make the songs relevant to a younger generation. Nora Guthrie contacted Bragg, who in turn approached Wilco and asked them to participate in the project as well. Wilco agreed, and in addition to recording with Bragg in Ireland, they were given their own share of songs to finish.\nRather than recreating tunes in Guthrie's style, Bragg and Wilco created new, contemporary music for the lyrics. Released in 1998 as Mermaid Avenue, the results were met with critical success. The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and went on to place fourth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1998.\nSince the release of the Mermaid Avenue albums, several other musicians have released recordings that similarly have drawn upon  unpublished Guthrie material.Man in the Sand, a documentary about the collaboration between Billy Bragg and Wilco, was released in 1999. A DVD of the film is included in Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions.\nBob Dylan tells in his autobiography that Woody Guthrie asked him to reach out to Guthrie's wife Margie and get the boxes of songs and poems that had been written but never set to melodies. Dylan makes his way to Guthrie's place but Margie was not there, only Guthrie's son Arlo and the babysitter. Neither had any idea about the box, and Dylan headed back to New York. Dylan writes in his autobiography Chronicles: \"Forty years later, these lyrics would fall into the hands of Billy Bragg and the group Wilco and they would put melodies to them, bring them to full life and record them.

The release has received positive reviews.\n\n\n== Recording and release ==\nWilco recorded the album in their Chicago studios in early 2019; on July 16, they announced the album, released lead single \"Love Is Everywhere (Beware)\", and announced tour dates. The live performances break a two and a half year hiatus for the band from touring and a year off in general. \"Everyone Hides\" was released as the album's second single on September 17, 2019. The album was recorded by taking simple song sketches from singer Jeff Tweedy, recording them in the studio with drummer Glenn Kotche, and then introducing the rest of the band to flesh out the musical ideas.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Ode to Joy received \"universal acclaim\" based on a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 from 25 critic reviews. Erin Osmon of Uncut praised the album, writing, \"It's a protest record only this sextet could make, one that rings loudest in its simplicity. It favours subtle textures and hushed vocals, and further reveals its wisdom with each listen.\" Prior to its release, Paste named this one of the albums the writers were most excited about for October, citing the band's diversity and calling this release, \"larger-than-life soft rock full of both grand ideas about the state of our world and small musings about matters of the heart\". Reviewing the album for AllMusic Mark Deming claimed the band were, \"more than willing to explore the boundaries of their music, and they do so with the confidence and sense of daring that has marked their best work from Being There onward.\" Michael Hann of The Guardian gave the release four out of five stars, praising the lyrics expressiveness and the different\u2014if not quite experimental\u2014use of varied instrumentation.\nNile Amos of Vinyl Chapters stated, \"the album urges us, in the present world, to hunker down and appreciate loved ones and each other, more now than ever.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks written by Jeff Tweedy.\n\n\"Bright Leaves\" \u2013 4:10\n\"Before Us\" \u2013 3:22\n\"One and a Half Stars\" \u2013 3:44\n\"Quiet Amplifier\" \u2013 5:50\n\"Everyone Hides\" \u2013 3:00\n\"White Wooden Cross\" \u2013 3:12\n\"Citizens\" \u2013 3:03\n\"We Were Lucky\" \u2013 4:56\n\"Love Is Everywhere (Beware)\" \u2013 3:34\n\"Hold Me Anyway\" \u2013 4:00\n\"An Empty Corner\" \u2013 3:46\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from liner notes.Wilco\n\nNels Cline \u2013 guitar\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 keyboards\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 drums, percussion\nPat Sansone \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass guitar\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 vocals, guitar, production, package designAdditional personnel\n\nLawrence Azerrad \u2013 packaging design\nMark Greenberg \u2013 engineering assistance\nBob Ludwig \u2013 mastering\nZoran Orlic \u2013 photography\nTom Schick \u2013 engineering, mixing, production\nPaul Von Mertens \u2013 saxophone\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nOde to Joy at Discogs (list of releases)\nOde to Joy at MusicBrainz (list of releases)","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Star_empty.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/51\/Star_full.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/81\/Star_half.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/7\/75\/Wilco_-_Ode_to_Joy.jpg"],"links":["A.M.

band Wilco, released on September 9, 2016 through dBpm Records. Wilco announced the album on July 19, 2016, and released two songs, \"Locator\" and \"If I Ever Was a Child\". The album's announcement came a little more than a year after their previous studio album, Star Wars.\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn February 2016, Jeff Tweedy first mentioned in an interview that Wilco would be releasing an album in 2016, though did not go into detail. During his solo benefit shows in Chicago later in May, Tweedy said they had finished the new record, but the band wasn't sure they wanted to release it yet. In July 2016, Wilco released \"Locator\" from the album to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Star Wars and then announced Schmilco several days later, in addition to releasing \"If I Ever Was a Child\" and \"Someone to Lose\". In September several days before the release, Wilco had \"I Heard Schmilco\" events at record stores to promote the album across the country where people could listen to the album and then buy it on vinyl.The album's name is a nod to the Harry Nilsson album Nilsson Schmilsson. The artwork was created by illustrator Joan Cornell\u00e0 in collaboration with Stefania Lusini.\nOn the album, Tweedy tells stories of himself, his family, and his history.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAccording to the review aggregator Metacritic, Schmilco received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 from 26 critic reviews.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nWilco\n\nNels Cline \u2013 guitar\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 keyboard\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 drums\nPat Sansone \u2013 guitar, keyboard\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass guitar\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, productionAdditional personnel\n\nJoan Cornell\u00e0 \u2013 cover art\nMark Greenberg \u2013 engineering\nBob Ludwig \u2013 mastering\nTom Schick \u2013 production\nSpencer Tweedy \u2013 drums\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nSchmilco at Discogs (list of releases)\nSchmilco at MusicBrainz (list of releases)","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Star_empty.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/51\/Star_full.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/81\/Star_half.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1c\/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/6\/6c\/Wiki_letter_w.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/cb\/Wilco_-_Schmilco.png"],"links":["A.M.

15, 2007 by Nonesuch Records. Originally announced on January 17, 2007 at a show in Nashville, Tennessee, it was the band's first studio album with guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone. Before its release, the band streamed the entire album on its official website and offered a free download of \"What Light\".\nSky Blue Sky was Wilco's highest debuting album on the Billboard 200 at number four. The self-produced album received mostly favorable reviews by critics. Publications such as PopMatters and Rolling Stone praised its maturity, while Playlouder and Pitchfork criticized its \"dad-rock\" sound. While some critics praised the direct lyrical approach, others criticized it when compared to previous Wilco albums. In 2021, Pitchfork published an article revising their opinion, calling the album \"essential\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn April 2006, Wilco was still touring in support of their most recent studio album, A Ghost Is Born which was released in 2004. The band performed a few new songs during this leg of the tour, including \"Walken\", \"Either Way\", and \"On and On and On\". The following month, drummer Glenn Kotche mentioned to Pitchfork that those new songs were going to be recorded as demos for a new album release. During a January 17, 2007 solo concert, frontman Jeff Tweedy announced that the band would release their sixth studio album on May 15, 2007 through Nonesuch Records. The album was named Sky Blue Sky, a reference to a childhood memory of Tweedy's, of a Memorial Day parade in Belleville, Illinois. He had come home from St. Louis with his family, but could not reach his house because the parade blocked the main street. This led Tweedy to reflect upon his future in the town: he knew that he would have to leave when he grew up because it was too small.The album was recorded by TJ Doherty at The Loft in Irving Park, Chicago, where Tweedy had recorded Loose Fur's Born Again in the USA and most of Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. In an interview with Billboard, the band revealed that the album would be less experimental than the two previous albums and more influenced by The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones. Also, unlike the previous albums, Sky Blue Sky was made with minimal involvement from Jim O'Rourke; resulting in very few overdubs.\n\n\n=== Composition ===\n\nThe band sought to be more direct with this record than the previous two, resulting in a more mellow album. Tweedy attributes the lyrical directness to his listening to material by The Byrds and Fairport Convention while recording the album. He disliked the reliance on studio effects on previous albums:\nI got nervous about the technology on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. If you need a certain amp or pedal to make a song what it is, it isn't a song.\nMany of the album's songs were recorded in a single day, with the band reaching a consensus on how each song should sound. Eighteen songs were recorded for the album and twelve were selected for the album's track listing. The outtake \"Let's Not Get Carried Away\" was included with iTunes digital downloads, and a full-band version of \"The Thanks I Get\" was released on the band's Myspace page. Some albums that were shipped to independent record stores included an EP featuring the outtake \"One True Vine\" and a live version of \"Theologians\" recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. A deluxe edition of Sky Blue Sky was also released, which included a DVD with eight live performances from the Wilco Loft.Unlike previous Wilco albums, Sky Blue Sky features more songwriting collaboration between Tweedy and the other members of the band. As a result, a variety of lyrical themes appear on Sky Blue Sky (Tweedy was the only designer of the songs on A Ghost Is Born, using Pro Tools, before presenting them to the band). The title track references the worries Tweedy had as a child in a small town while \"On and On and On\" is an ode to Tweedy's father's experience after the death of Tweedy's mother. \"Hate It Here\" describes a man who tries to fill his free time with chores after breaking up with his lover.Sky Blue Sky was the band's first studio record to feature the expanded lineup that premiered on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago. Guitarist Jeff Tweedy provided the lead vocals for the album and John Stirratt, the only other original member of the band, played bass guitar and added background vocals. Glenn Kotche played drums and Mikael Jorgensen performed on a variety of keyboards. New to the band since the previous studio album were lead guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone. Additional instrumentation was provided by violist Karen Waltuch and multi-instrumentalist Jim O'Rourke. The album was mixed by Jim Scott at PLYRZ Studios in Santa Clarita, California.\n\n\n=== Artwork ===\nThe cover artwork of Sky Blue Sky is a photograph by Manuel Presti titled \"Sky Chase.\" The photograph was taken in Rome, Italy, and helped Presti win the 2005 Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. The same photograph is featured in the July 2007 issue of National Geographic.  Nathaniel Murphy provided several illustrations for the liner booklet, which include a tree on a hill, a hand, and a flock of birds. The booklet also contains photographs of the band members by Frank Ockenfels. Graphic design was provided by Jeff Tweedy and Lawrence Azerrad.\n\n\n== Marketing and promotion ==\nOn March 3, 2007, Wilco's official website hosted a Sky Blue Sky \"listening party\", which streamed the new album in its entirety. Two days later, the track \"What Light\" was made available for download on the band's website and was streamed on its MySpace page. On March 11, 2007, the official website streamed the album in its entirety again. \"The Thanks I Get\", a song recorded during the Sky Blue Sky sessions but not included on the album, was made available as a free download to purchasers of the album. During the European segment of the promotional tour, Wilco included a five-song extended play with purchase of the album. The EP contained the songs \"The Thanks I Get\", \"One True Vine\", \"Let's Not Get Carried Away\", and live versions of \"Impossible Germany\" and \"Hate It Here\". Wilco made the EP available online for free to previous purchasers of Sky Blue Sky.Frustrated by the lack of radio airplay received by previous Wilco albums, the band decided to branch out into television advertising. Wilco had previously licensed songs for Telef\u00f3nica Moviles, and Jeff Tweedy appeared in a series of advertisements for Apple Computer. In May 2007, Volkswagen began running a pair of commercials with \"You Are My Face\" and bonus track \"The Thanks I Get\" playing in the background. The band commented on their website that \"we feel okay about VWs. Several of us even drive them.\" The band licensed six songs for the campaign, which was created by advertising agency Crispin Porter and Bogusky. The move was met with criticism from both fans and popular media.A promotional tour followed the release of the album. The band performed \"Sky Blue Sky\" and \"You Are My Face\" on Later... with Jools Holland on May 25, 2007 and was interviewed on The Dermot O'Leary Show the next day. Beginning June 13, 2007, Wilco played fourteen shows in North America  with Low as its opening act. Following this, the band made plans to tour Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, and Spain before playing a few more North American shows, including a performance on The Tonight Show.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nNonesuch released the album on May 15, 2007; the following week became Wilco's best-ever sales week. The album debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 87,000 copies domestically in its first week. Sky Blue Sky was also an international success, peaking at number 7 in Norway, number 21 in Belgium, number 23 in Australia and Ireland, number 26 in Sweden, number 32 in New Zealand, number 36 in Germany, and number 39 in the United Kingdom.The album maintains a score of 73 out of 100 from Metacritic from 38 critics based on \"generally favorable reviews\" upon its release. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone pondered in his review whether Wilco had ever made a song as good as \"Impossible Germany,\" praising how the song builds into a \"twin guitar epic\" in the mold of Television and Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac. Michael Metivier of PopMatters commented that while the album took a while to understand, it was full of \"exquisitely beautiful melodies and performances\". AllMusic writer Mark Deming called the album \"Wilco's strongest album as an ensemble to date,\" and found the return to roots rock music a fresh new method for the band. Blender gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that the album \"often feels like the [Grateful] Dead's American Beauty if Jerry Garcia had taken Paxil instead of acid.\"Colin Stutz of Filter gave the album a score of 91% and stated: \"Wilco has constructed their most straightforward release in recent memory, which relies heavily on the inspired intricacies of a full-hearted band.\" Richard Cromelin of Los Angeles Times gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"The most musically direct and down to earth of the band's six-album career.\" Andrew C. Bradick of Prefix Magazine gave the album a favorable review and called it \"Wilco's first step toward aging well, but it transcends transition and is an album that sounds right in its place and time.\" Alan Shulman of No Ripcord gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and said, \"Wilco has come up with 50% of a classic album and 50% of a merely decent one. Buy it for the moments you simply won\u2019t hear anywhere else.\" Will Hermes of Spin gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it \"A near-perfect album by a band that seems, finally, to have found their identity.\" Alternative Press gave it four stars out of five and said, \"It's apparent it takes deft skill to sound this simple.\" Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it four stars out of five and stated: \"While the elders will rejoice [in] this sober, satisfied, and craftily subdued effort, the younglings of the bunch, with their abbreviated attention spans, iPod shuffles, and demand for instant gratification, will declare the album a boring and lethargic affair.\" Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that \"Though it may not fit comfortably alongside any other albums in Wilco's catalogue, Sky Blue Sky is further confirmation that, even at their most retro, they're among contemporary pop music's most vital acts.\" Likewise, Graeme Thomson of The Observer gave it four stars and said, \"The closer you listen to the jazzy guitars, Beatles touches and easy, shuffling rhythms ... the more it transpires that Tweedy is simply allowing the songs sufficient room to speak up for themselves.\"John Pareles of The New York Times gave the album a positive review and said, \"The production is straightforward, but the song structures aren\u2019t; that\u2019s where Wilco\u2019s idiosyncrasies still hide out.\" Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe also gave it a positive review and said the band \"hasn't forsaken its experimental streak, and the group uses it in the service of darkness -- or rather the threat of darkness.\"However, not all publications praised the new style of Sky Blue Sky. Stylus Magazine editor Ian Cohen criticized the album's disregard for the \"fourth wall\", and expressed concern about its dissimilarities to Kicking Television: Live in Chicago. Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian gave the album three stars out of five and said, \"On its own terms, Sky Blue Sky succeeds: it's tender, poignant and sumptuously textured, occasionally jolted into fiery life by flaring guitar passages redolent of Neil Young or Television.\" Now gave it a positive review and stated: \"All those self-consciously avant bits of the two previous albums have been ditched along with Jeff Tweedy's laughable lyrical abstractions in favour of tuneful, direct songs that at least seem to carry some emotional weight.\" Ted Grant of Playlouder gave the album two stars out of five and called it the \"blandest and most creatively uninspired record of their career\", finding that the album was leading to tame \"dad-rock\". Pitchfork writer Rob Mitchum also used the \"dad-rock\" colloquialism, dismissing its straightforwardness and arguing \"Tweedy merely ended up with the wrong personnel to articulate his mood here.\" Mojo also gave the album three stars out of five, stating that \"Many longtime listeners... are sure to be disappointed with the radio-friendly production and sheer innocuousness of [the] lyrics.\" Andy Gill of Uncut gave the album three stars out of five and called it \"a slight disappointment\". Billboard gave it an average review and stated: \"On first listen, it might seem too derivative, even dull, but Jeff Tweedy's intricate vocal melodies and Nels Cline's ferocious guitar work keep things interesting.\" Under the Radar gave it five stars out of ten and called it \"a very professional but almost inconsequential set... flat and ultimately uninspired.\" John Walshe of Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said the album was \"just too 'nice'.\"The lyrical content was considered by critics to be somewhat experimental, but more straightforward than previous Wilco albums. Michael Metevier of PopMatters found the lyrics to be \"some of the most affecting and least clumsy\" of the band's career, though he worried that they might strike some Wilco fans as dull. Rob Sheffield said that while he was unimpressed with the lyrics of other Wilco albums, he liked the songwriting on Sky Blue Sky. However, Brandon Kreitler of Dusted Magazine felt that the lyrics seem like an insular Tweedy confessional, and Doug Freeman of The Austin Chronicle described the collaborative songwriting as yielding \"fatalistic ambivalence\" while giving the album two stars out of five.The album received a nomination at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. It placed 12th in the 2008 Pazz & Jop Poll. This album was #42 on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007, and the song \"Impossible Germany\" was #71 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. WXPN named \"Impossible Germany\" as the #1 song of 2007 and named the album as a whole the #1 album of 2007. Sky Blue Sky was named one of the ten best albums of the year by Billboard, Paste, Uncut, and The A.V. Club. The album was placed at #97 on the Rolling Stone 100 Best Albums Of The 2000s list.\nIn a 2021 article revising a collection of the website's previous reviews, Pitchfork writer Sam Sodomsky called the album \"essential\" and informally revised its 5.2 score to an 8.5.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nWilcoNels Cline \u2013 Lead Electric Guitar (1,3,5), Lead Electric 12-String Guitar (2), Lap Steel Guitar (4,10,11), Electric Guitar (6,8,9,11), Loops (9), Electric 12-String Guitar (12)\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 Piano (1-5,7-10), Hammond A100 Organ (3,11,12), Wurlitzer (6), Hammond B3 Organ (10)\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 Drums (1-6,8-12), Percussion (3,6,11,12), Glockenspiel (7)\nPat Sansone \u2013 Hammond A100 Organ (1,2,5), Vocals (2), Acoustic Guitar (2,7), Electric Guitar (3,6,10), Chamberlin (4), Mellotron (5,9), Wurlitzer (8), Harpsichord (9), Piano (11,12), Backing Vocals (11)\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 Bass (1-12), Vocals (2), 8-String Guitar (8), Backing Vocals (11)\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 Vocals (1-12), Electric Guitar (1-10), Acoustic Guitar (4,7), Acoustic 12-String Guitar (11)Additional musiciansJim O'Rourke \u2013 Feedback (2), Percussion (8), Acoustic Guitar (11), String Arrangements (1,12)\nKaren Waltuch \u2013 Viola (1,12), Violin (1,12)Production and designLawrence Azerrad \u2013 graphic design\nTJ Doherty \u2013 recording\nRobert Ludwig \u2013 mastering\nNathaniel Murphy \u2013 illustrations\nFrack Ockenfels \u2013 photography\nManuel Presti \u2013 cover photograph\nJim Scott \u2013 mixing\nJason Tobias, Tom Gloady, Kevin Dean \u2013 assistant engineering\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKot, Greg (2004).

It was self-released for free on July 16, 2015, through wilcoworld.net. It is the second Wilco album that was released on their own label dBpm. A CD version of the album was released on August 21 and a vinyl version was released on October 13. The album emerged from Wilco recording sessions at The Loft that also resulted in their 2016 album Schmilco.\n\n\n== Cover art ==\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Wilco lead singer Jeff Tweedy explained the cover art and album title.\nIt's kind of an extension of the thought process behind, I don't know, staying in touch with some sort of wild energy as much as possible and some sort of an irreverence. But that painting of that cat hangs in the kitchen at the [Wilco] loft, and every day I'd look at it and go, \"You know, that should just be the album cover.\" Then I started thinking about the phrase \"Star Wars\" recontextualized against that painting\u2014it was beautiful and jarring. The album has nothing to do with Star Wars. It just makes me feel good. It makes me feel limitless and like there's still possibilities and still surprise in the world, you know?In a November 2018 interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Jeff Tweedy stated that they were prepared to rename and redistribute the album as 'Cease and Desist' as they assumed they would be sued by George Lucas. They allegedly also prepared album artwork featuring  McDonald's Golden Arches upside-down as the W in Wilco.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe album debuted at No. 105 on Billboard 200, and No. 18 on Top Rock Albums for charts dated September 12, 2015, selling 6,000 copies in the first week. \nThe album has sold 21,000 copies in the United States as of August 2016.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Jeff Tweedy, except for \"You Satellite\" co-written by Tweedy, Glenn Kotche and Nels Cline, \"Taste the Ceiling\" by Tweedy and Scott McCaughey, and \"Magnetized\" by Tweedy and Mikael Jorgensen.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nWilco\n\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar, vocals\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass, acoustic guitar, vocals\nGlenn Kotche \u2013 drums, percussion\nMikael Jorgensen \u2013 keyboards\nNels Cline \u2013 electric guitar, loops\nPatrick Sansone \u2013 electric guitar, keyboards, vocalsAdditional musicians\n\nSpencer Tweedy \u2013 additional percussion\nScott McCaughey \u2013 Mellotron and piano on \"Taste the Ceiling\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==","images":["https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Star_empty.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/51\/Star_full.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/81\/Star_half.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8a\/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg","https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/e\/ea\/Star_Wars_Wilco.jpg"],"links":["A.M.

his son Spencer. It was released on September 23, 2014, and features 20 new songs. The album is promoted by a new band touring under the Tweedy name.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\nAfter producing albums for Low, White Denim, and Mavis Staples, Jeff Tweedy set out to create a solo album. From the start, the album was intended to be more than simply acoustic guitar and vocals. While recording demos, Tweedy's son Spencer joined him to record drums and \"[help] the songs take shape\". Tweedy had most previously worked with his son when they both appeared on the split single for the \"Songs For Slim\" series in 2013. Sukierae was completed mostly by the two of them, but also features additional vocals by Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of the band Lucius, as well as keyboards by Scott McCaughey.In an interview with The Atlantic, Tweedy spoke about the creative process of making the album and why he decided to release it as a solo album instead of a new Wilco album:\n\"I like to include elements of early recordings on the finished records when I can. Almost every song on Sukierae has an original demo element somewhere in there. A lot of my iPhone acoustic demos became the basic tracks we overdubbed to, and they\u2019re still there in the finished record. (That\u2019s why we listed the iPhone as an instrument in the track notes.) The song \u201cI\u2019ll Sing It\u201d includes a cassette recording from a \"Being There\" -era demo of that song. Stuff lies around forever, and for this record it was fun to make some use of it.\"It\u2019s a totally different process working with an ensemble. Wilco is a six-piece band, and its members have varying degrees of interest in the finishing touches. As a collective, we always gravitate towards something much more fully realized\u2014and that\u2019s the pleasure of it. Working on my own, I always hope to abandon something before I feel like I\u2019ve made all of the choices that could be made. If I commit too much to one approach, I mourn all the choices that weren\u2019t made when I get to that point. I think that\u2019s one way Sukierae would have been different if it had been recorded by Wilco. I can still hear possible overdubs on every track, I can still hear things I could have done, and that\u2019s the most enjoyable part for me. It\u2019s the same thing I love about Daniel Johnston\u2019s music\u2014all that unrealized potential.\"Jeff Tweedy had mentioned that he had 90 new songs that he had written, but not recorded, when interviewed in 2013 about the prospect of a new Wilco album. Material for a new album has since been recorded, but so far has not been released. In the meantime, all members of the band have released or appeared on numerous albums, from one-off collaborations, to their more closely related projects of The Autumn Defense and The Nels Cline Singers.In an interview with The Guardian Tweedy shared his thoughts on the Album as a format in 2014.  He also elaborated on the creative process of sequencing Sukierae as a double album:\n\"I\u2019ve just made a double album, Sukierae, which has two distinct discs. I understand in this day and age there might not be many people who will listen to it that way, but it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 because I want to listen that way. I\u2019m not a curmudgeon, a luddite or anti-modern technology doomsayer. I just want to listen to the album and have a feeling that one part, has ended, and now I can take a little breather before I listen to the second part. Or I can listen to the second part another time. It\u2019s a double record on vinyl, so there are three breaks like that. I wanted it to have different identities artistically and the album format allows me to do that.\"\"Working toward Sukierae I must have written or recorded around 90 songs. I was pretty sold on the idea of two really good-sounding vinyl sides, but no matter how we tried to sequence the songs, we kept getting halfway into another record. Then, in the last couple of weeks of recording, I had this burst and recorded five new songs, which all started to feel like part of a whole other record. So, we sequenced it as disc one and disc two. The album gets simpler and softer and bolder at the same time. The idea is that as it winds down it gets clearer.\"\"These are key tracks but deliberately placed to be heard in the middle of the album. Listening to it all at once is a leap of faith, but I know that the idea of listening to a work all the way through and being taken along for the whole ride is becoming antiquated for a lot of people.\"The album will be released through dBpm Records, a record label founded by the members of Wilco in 2011. This is the third album release by the label, following The Whole Love and its corresponding deluxe edition release.\n\n\n== Touring band ==\nJeff and Spencer Tweedy rounded out the project into a full band in order to tour, adding Jim Elkington as an additional guitarist, bassist Darin Gray, and keyboardist\/guitarist Liam Cunningham. The band first played at the Detroit Masonic Temple on June 5, where they played 13 of the songs from the new album.During a Tweedy show, the first half features the full band playing many of the songs from Sukierae, exclusively. So far, the band has not played \"I'll Sing It\" the first single from the album. For the second half, Jeff Tweedy plays a solo acoustic set. At this point, he does not play additional material from Sukierae, but instead draws from songs from his careers in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, along with covers and songs from other projects. These acoustic sets are effectively truncated versions of the solo acoustic performances that Jeff Tweedy has done concurrently throughout his tenure in Wilco.\n\n\n== Promotion ==\nOn May 18, 2014 it was announced that Jeff Tweedy would be releasing a solo album in September, and that he would also begin a solo tour. It was not until June 4 that the nature of the band was revealed, along with its name, number of songs, and a stream for the song \"I'll Sing It\". This song was named the first single from the forthcoming album. \"Summer Noon\" followed in the form of a music video, and on July 8, it was released as part of the soundtrack to the Richard Linklater film Boyhood. Third was \"Wait For Love\", previewed both in its album form, and as a video of a solo acoustic performance.The song \"Diamond Light, Pt. 1\" was premiered on Stereogum as a SoundCloud stream, and along with \"Diamond Light, Pt. 2\" was released on a 10\" vinyl record on June 17. While \"Diamond Light, Pt. 1\" would go on to appear on Sukierae, \"Diamond Light, Pt. 2\" only appears on this release. This release was limited to 2,000 copies and was pressed on virgin \"clear\/smoke\" vinyl. Both sides of the record end with a locked groove (uncommon for 10\" records).Lastly, the song Fake Fur Coat was premiered on VH1 music on July 24.On July 24, Tweedy performed \"Summer Noon\" and \"High As Hello\" on The Tonight Show.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Musicians ==\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 Vocals (1\u201320), Guitar (1\u201320), Bass (1\u20134,6\u201313,15\u201317,19), iPhone Track

American alternative rock band Wilco (stylized as wilco), released on March 9, 1999, by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's marital problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed in the studio with Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.\nThe album was met with critical acclaim from numerous outlets, including AllMusic, the Chicago Tribune and The Village Voice. Summerteeth sold approximately 200,000 copies, a modest number compared to the sales of their previous album Being There (1996). Wilco agreed to remix \"Can't Stand It\" with David Kahne to cater to radio markets, but the single failed to attract substantial airplay.\n\n\n== Background and production ==\nWilco released Being There in 1996 to a higher level of commercial success than its first album, A.M., selling 300,000 copies (nearly double the number of its first record). After the promotional tour to support Being There, Wilco began to record tracks for a third album. The initial Summerteeth recording sessions were in November 1997 at Willie Nelson's music studio in Spicewood, Texas. Lead singer Jeff Tweedy was particularly emotional during the sessions because he was upset that he was unable to spend time with his wife and son because of the constant touring schedule. As a result, the songs recorded then reflected an introspective view that was also influenced by literature that Tweedy was reading at the time. While touring, Tweedy would read books by Henry Miller, William H. Gass and John Fante. According to Tweedy:\nI definitely wanted to get better at writing, and those things happened simultaneously with trying to read better. I would write tons of stuff in my head, and forget. Some songs on Being There, I don't think I ever wrote any lyrics down ... To fight that, I started writing words on paper and making up melodies to go with them. By writing things down, and putting more words into my head, it put more words in my mouth when I turned on the tape recorder to sing.\nThe sessions produced a number of songs, including \"I'm Always in Love\", \"She's a Jar\" and the Henry Miller-inspired murder ballad \"Via Chicago\". Tweedy's relationship with his wife Sue Miller became the inspiration for several of the songs, although she was portrayed mostly in a negative sense. Miller was reluctantly willing to give Tweedy the creative license to write songs, but was concerned about lyrics such as \"she begs me not to hit her\" from \"She's a Jar\".\nBefore the album was completed, Wilco decided to collaborate with Billy Bragg on the album that became Mermaid Avenue. Once the Mermaid Avenue sessions were completed, Wilco entered Chicago's Kingsize Soundlabs with engineers Dave Trumfio and Mike Hagler to finish Summerteeth. Tweedy and Bennett wanted to start the recording sessions again by experimenting with a new approach to mixing the songs. Unlike previous material, which was performed live in the studio, the pair heavily overdubbed many of the songs with Pro Tools. As a result, the contributions of other members were diminished. To complement the \"bold, but depressing\" lyrics, Tweedy relied more heavily on the production skills of the multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett, who played a variety of instruments besides his usual lead guitar and keyboard work, including Mellotron, tambourine and synthesizers. Bennett even played the bass guitar and drums when the bass guitarist John Stirratt and drummer Ken Coomer were not in the studio. Coomer was not pleased about a reduced role in the band:\nIt was a circling of the wagons, and John and I felt left out. It was Jeff and Jay feeding off each other not just musically, but other vices. There was a bonding going on, and it didn't just involve music. Jeff didn't go into rehab [for an addiction to painkillers], but he should've,  [sic] in my opinion. Jay was taking painkillers, antidepressants, and wasn't in much better shape. The band was different. There wasn't really a band, just two guys losing their minds in the studio.\nAfter a series of personnel changes, Reprise Records sought to release a hit single from the album to increase album sales. Wilco agreed to do this \"once and once only\" on the basis that they wanted to cooperate with the label that allowed them such freedom. The band and Reprise executives agreed to re-mix \"Can't Stand It\" to make it more radio-friendly. Within one day, the song was remixed into the version that appeared on Summerteeth, cutting out portions of the bridge and adding bells. \"Can't Stand It\" failed to cross over from adult album alternative to modern rock radio stations.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon release, Summerteeth peaked at number 78 on the Billboard 200. It was their first album to chart in the top 40 in the United Kingdom. By 2003, it had sold over 200,000 copies. The album was placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999, and Pitchfork gave it position 31 in its list of the best albums of the 1990s.Jason Ankeny of AllMusic gave the album five stars, lauding its \"lush string arrangements and gorgeous harmonies\". Ankeny also compared the music on the album to The Band in their prime. Pitchfork writer Neil Lieberman praised how Wilco \"craft[ed] an album as wonderfully ambiguous and beautifully uncertain as life itself\" and how Bennett \"paint[ed] the album in Technicolor\". Robert Christgau gave the album a two-star honorable mention, calling it \"old-fashioned tunecraft lacking not pedal steel, who cares, but the concreteness modern popcraft eschews\". The Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot championed the album in his review and ranked it the year's best album, calling it \"pop so gorgeous it belies the intricate studio experimentation that brought it to life\".\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Jay Bennett and Jeff Tweedy, except where noted.\n\n\"Can't Stand It\" \u2013 3:46\n\"She's a Jar\" \u2013 4:43\n\"A Shot in the Arm\" (Bennett, John Stirratt, Tweedy) \u2013 4:19\n\"We're Just Friends\" (Bennett, Stirratt, Tweedy) \u2013 2:44\n\"I'm Always in Love\" \u2013 3:41\n\"Nothing'severgonnastandinmyway(Again)\" (Bennett, Stirratt, Tweedy) \u2013 3:20\n\"Pieholden Suite\" \u2013 3:26\n\"How to Fight Loneliness\" \u2013 3:53\n\"Via Chicago\" (Tweedy) \u2013 5:33\n\"ELT\" \u2013 3:46\n\"My Darling\" \u2013 3:38\n\"When You Wake Up Feeling Old\" (Tweedy) \u2013 3:56\n\"Summer Teeth\" \u2013 3:21\n\"In a Future Age\" \u2013 2:57Hidden tracks\n23 seconds of silence (silence) \u2013 0:23\n\"Candyfloss\" \u2013 2:57\n\"A Shot in the Arm\" (Remix version) (Bennett, Stirratt, Tweedy) \u2013 3:54Canadian promo bonus disc\nAnd Sum Aren't\"I Must Be High\"\n\"Pick Up the Change\"\n\"Passenger Side\"\n\"Monday\" (Demo Version)\n\"I Got You (At the End of the Century)\"\n\"Hotel Arizona\"\n\"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\" (Live)\n\"Someone Else's Song\"\n\"Red Eyed and Blue\" (Live)\n\"Box Full of Letters\" (Live)\n\"Why Would You Wanna\" (Live)\n\"Forget the Flowers\" (Live)\n\"The Lonely 1\"\n\"Sunken Treasure\" (Live)\n\"At My Window Sad and Lonely\"\n\"Blasting Fonda\"\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 vocals (1\u201314, 16), electric guitar (1, 9), backing vocals (1, 2, 10, 11), acoustic guitar (2, 3, 6\u20139, 11\u201314, 16), harmonica (2), 12-string guitar (3), synthesizers (3, 9), baritone guitar (5), claps (6), bass guitar (7), tambourine (7), toy harp (12), bowed and tremolo guitars (14)\nJay Bennett \u2013 piano (1, 3\u20139, 11, 13, 14, 16), keyboards (1\u20133, 5\u20138, 10\u201313, 16), bells (1, 13), percussion (1), backing vocals (1, 2, 4\u20138, 10\u201314, 16), electric guitar (2, 10, 11, 13, 16), tambourine (2, 6, 7, 9-11), lap steel (3, 13), synthesizers (3, 7, 10), drums (3, 5, 17), Farfisa (4), bass drum (4), bass guitar (5), baritone guitar (6, 11, 16), e-bow guitar (6, 11), claps (11), banjo (7, 9), organ (9, 14, 16), Moog (9), slide bass (11), tiple (12)\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass guitar (1\u20133, 6\u201314, 16), backing vocals (4\u20138, 11\u201313, 16), piano (5)\nKen Coomer \u2013 drums (1, 2, 5\u201314, 16), timpani (3)\nLeroy Bach \u2013 piano (12)\nDave Crawford \u2013 trumpet (7)\nMark Greenberg \u2013 vibraphone (11)\nDavid Campbell \u2014 String arrangements (1)\nMitch Easter, Chris Grainger, Larry Greenhill, Mike Hagler, Russ Long, David Trumfio \u2013 engineers\nDavid Kahne, Jim Scott \u2013 mixing\nMike Scotella \u2013 mixing assistant\nSteve Chadie \u2013 assistant engineer\nLawrence Azerrad \u2013 artwork, graphic design\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Appearance in media ==\n\"How to Fight Loneliness\" can be heard at the end of \"Something Old\" episode of How I Met Your Mother and was included in the soundtrack of the movie Girl, Interrupted (1999), and at the end of \"You Must Remember This\" episode of House (Season 7 episode 12).\n\"My Darling\" was included in season 1, episode 4 \"The Deer Hunters\" of \"Gilmore Girls\" (2000).\n\"Summerteeth\" is mentioned as a minor plot-element in Jo Nesb\u00f8's novel Phantom (2012)\n\"She's a Jar\" was featured in the movie The Darwin Awards (2006).\n\u201cVia Chicago\u201d was featured in Hulu TV series The Bear (TV series).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nKot, Greg (2004).

Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mike Heidorn formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album Anodyne, Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed Son Volt with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as Wilco.\nAlthough Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene. The group's first album, No Depression, became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the hardcore punk of The Minutemen and the country instrumentation and harmony of the Carter Family and Hank Williams. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to Middle America and the working class of Belleville.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The Plebes and The Primitives ===\nJay Farrar, along with his brothers Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.Before leaving the band in 1984, Dade Farrar introduced its members to Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nThe Primitives renamed itself Uncle Tupelo after a character in a cartoon drawn by Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band's members. The name was created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary; inspired by the name, Wagner drew a picture of an old, fat Elvis. The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which won them supporting roles at the concerts of artists such as Johnny Thunders and Warren Zevon. Tweedy met Tony Margherita while moonlighting as a record clerk in St. Louis. After attending a pair of the band's concerts, Margherita offered to become its manager. Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement\u2014a bar close to the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. Bands playing in a similar style, including Brian Henneman's Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered to have been the origin of a new music scene. The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.Uncle Tupelo recorded its first tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer Matt Allison in Champaign, Illinois. The demo Not Forever, Just for Now includes the songs \"I Got Drunk\" and \"Screen Door\", as well as early versions of several songs that would appear on their first studio album. The CMJ New Music Report gave the tape a rave review, and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year. The accolade attracted the attention of independent labels, and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie Southwood-Smith of Giant Records (who offered to book them at CBGB in New York City). Explaining the decision, the band said that \"[our] original goals don't get distorted with an independent label.\"\n\n\n=== Recordings on Rockville Records ===\n\nShortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records changed its name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville, No Depression, was recorded over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.'s Bug, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on Bug. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.\nIn between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member of The Bottle Rockets). Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo, and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.By March 1991, No Depression had sold an estimated 15,000 copies, and was featured in a Rolling Stone article about rising stars. However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue for the remainder of the band's contract. Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at Long View Farm in rural North Brookfield, Massachusetts. Still Feel Gone, with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and Gary Louris of The Jayhawks. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade. Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded \"Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy)\" on Michelle Shocked's album Arkansas Traveler and joined her on the accompanying tour with Taj Mahal and The Band. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.Alternative rock had broken into the mainstream by 1992, and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a major-label record deal. However, Uncle Tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as Nirvana, and decided to play country and folk songs \"as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene\". Peter Buck, guitarist for R.E.M., saw the trio perform at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia and sought them out after the show. Buck was impressed with a version of \"Atomic Power\" that the band played, and offered his services for their next album. Over a span of five days, Buck produced the group's next album, March 16\u201320, 1992. Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions, and charged no money for his services. Henneman's role was increased for this album, and he taught himself how to play mandolin and bouzouki. Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock, major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after March 16\u201320, 1992 was released. The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined, although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rock.\n\n\n=== Major label contract ===\nIn 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records began to pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been interested in them since hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums and specified a budget of $150,000 for the first.Around the time of the recording of March 16\u201320, 1992, Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.The band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for March 16\u201320, 1992, and two candidates stood out: Bill Belzer and Ken Coomer. Although Farrar and Tweedy agreed that Coomer was the better drummer, they were intimidated by his six-foot-four stature and long dreadlocks. The band instead selected Belzer as Heidorn's replacement, but he only stayed with the band for six months. Tweedy explained Belzer's departure:\nI want to believe it was purely musical, and I honestly believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives ... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.\nAfter touring Europe opening for Sugar, the band replaced Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: John Stirratt replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while Max Johnston, the brother of Michelle Shocked, joined as a live mandolin and violin performer. Stirratt became the full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.Now a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in Austin, Texas in early 1993. Anodyne consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and Doug Sahm of the Sir Douglas Quintet. The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. The group toured until the end of the year, finishing with a sold-out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit.In 1993, the band contributed a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's track \"Effigy\" to the AIDS-Benefit album No Alternative produced by the Red Hot Organization.\n\n\n=== Breakup ===\nWith the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled:\nAround this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.\nTweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and did not want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, rather than directly from Farrar. The following day, the two engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita, who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running, Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs. The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Sire had requested that the band perform \"The Long Cut\" on the show, which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy.\nUncle Tupelo's last concerts, two shows at The Blue Note in Columbia, Missouri and two shows at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, took place from April 28 to May 1, 1994. A special \"last leg\" poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as \"St. Louis's 4th best country band\", based on a readers' poll in the Riverfront Times. On the last night, Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert, and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore.\n\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\n\nFollowing Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created Wilco. They began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, A.M.. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, Son Volt; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with Joe Henry as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album Trace in November 1994.Wilco signed to Reprise Records while Son Volt signed with Warner Bros. Records. Son Volt had an early college rock hit with \"Drown\" from the album Trace, but Wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to follow. Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that \"nothing's ever for sure, but I would have to say, 'No such thing'.\" Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together, while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musically.Farrar and Tweedy sued Rockville Records and Dutch East India Trading CEO Barry Tenenbaum in 2000 over royalties that the label allegedly owed them, winning restitution from Tenenbaum and the joint rights to Uncle Tupelo's first three albums. After securing the rights, the band released a compilation entitled 89\/93: An Anthology. In 2003, Uncle Tupelo re-issued their first three albums, which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200,000 copies.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nAs The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. However, they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure. Farrar typically wrote songs about Middle America, while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships. Farrar took influence from authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and Jack Kerouac, whom he read while working at his mother's bookstore. As a singer, Farrar's lyrics would be front-and-center during performances, but the band's musical style was mostly driven by Tweedy and Heidorn. Jeff Tweedy said in an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:\nWe probably have more influences than we know what to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.\nTweedy in particular was inspired by the Minutemen, and wrote a song about D. Boon following Boon's death in a van accident. The band has released songs originally performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Carter Family, Lead Belly, Gram Parsons, The Soft Boys, The Louvin Brothers, Texas Tornados, and The Stooges. Releasing March 16\u201320, 1992 when alternative music was breaking through was a move inspired by Neil Young's decision to release the challenging albums On the Beach and Tonight's the Night immediately after the commercially successful Harvest. Critic Michael Corcoran likened the band's musical style to \"Bob Mould fronting Soul Asylum on a speeded-up version of a Gram Parsons song.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nUncle Tupelo is credited as one of the founders of the alternative country genre, a blend of alternative rock and traditional country music. While the genre eventually became associated with solo artists such as Gram Parsons and Lyle Lovett, Uncle Tupelo is considered the first alternative country band. Some media outlets like the BBC have even suggested that they were the genre's sole creator. However, Tweedy and Heidorn dispute this claim, and Farrar says that there is no difference between alternative country and other genres such as roots rock. Heidorn commented in a Country Standard Time interview:\nIt's strange to hear Uncle Tupelo mentioned because what we were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time\u2014doing what was right for the song.\nThe band's first three albums influenced contemporary roots rock artists such as Richmond Fontaine and Whiskeytown. Uncle Tupelo's usage of distorted guitars to play a style of music that was known for its earnestness became a lasting trend in 1990s modern rock. Jason Ankeny wrote in AllMusic that:\nWith the release of their 1990 debut LP, No Depression, the Belleville, IL, trio Uncle Tupelo launched more than simply their own career\u2014by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.\nTheir 1990 album No Depression lent its name to an influential alternative country periodical. Due to the influence of the album and periodical, the term \"No Depression\" became a byword for alternative country\u2014particularly for bands with punk rock influence. The alternative country movement played an important role in the success of future traditionalist country acts such as Robbie Fulks and Shelby Lynne.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJay Farrar \u2013 vocals, guitar (1987\u20131994)\nMike Heidorn \u2013 drums (1987\u20131992)\nJeff Tweedy \u2013 vocals, bass, guitar (1987\u20131994)\nBill Belzer \u2013 drums (1992)\nKen Coomer \u2013 drums (1992\u20131994)\nMax Johnston \u2013 violin, mandolin (1992\u20131994)\nJohn Stirratt \u2013 bass, guitar (1992\u20131994)Timeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Compilations ===\n\n\n=== Demo tapes ===\nAll demo tapes are self-released on cassette.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n=== Contributions ===\nUncle Tupelo also recorded a one-hour radio special that was released by Legacy Records in 2003.

Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released twelve studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.\nWilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \"eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres\".Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed \"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\" The event was immortalized in the documentary I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, in which director Sam Jones followed the band as they wrote and produced the record.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco released their twelfth studio album, Cruel Country, in May 2022.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nWilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets, who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, A.M.. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself \"Wilco\" after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for \"will comply\", a choice which Tweedy has called \"fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves.\"\n\n\n=== A.M. and Being There ===\nAfter collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song \"The T.B. is Whipping Me\" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission\u2014John Stirratt's \"It's Just That Simple\"\u2014appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as \"trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.\" A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice's 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.\n\nWilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as \"Black Shampoo\").During the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:\nThe whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on \"Misunderstood,\" where I'm playing guitar.\nA number of songs were recorded with this theme, including \"Sunken Treasure\" and \"Hotel Arizona\", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on \"Far, Far Away\" and \"Dreamer in My Dreams\", and then became an official member in September 1996.Unlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no desire to produce a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. Being There was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. The album reached No. 73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996. The album's single \"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\" became the group's first song to enter the Billboard charts, reaching No. 39 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\n\n=== Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions ===\nIn November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's \"bold, but depressing\" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including \"Via Chicago\" and \"She's a Jar\", but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.\nNora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a \"relic\" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was \"the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.\" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs with one of his idols\u2014Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a \"freak weirdo.\" The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film.Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded \"you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker.\" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.\nDespite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:\nThe story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.\nDuring 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc. As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this \"once and once only\" and recorded a radio-friendly version of \"Can't Stand It\" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department. The single version of \"Can't Stand It\" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There. This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.After the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. \"Someday Some Morning Sometime,\" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the \"piece to the puzzle\" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions. The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue Vol. III, also part of Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions.\n\n\n=== Yankee Hotel Foxtrot ===\n\nShortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\", and the results impressed the other band members\u2014even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as \"Poor Places\", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco.\nTime Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disliked the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.Wilco managed to negotiate a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco \"bought the finished studio tapes from Warner\/Reprise Records for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether\" after Wilco was \"[u]nwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'.\" To curb the negative publicity, Warner Music Group began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked:\nWe are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, \"we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again.\" They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!\nAs the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it on their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco's highest chart position to that date. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best-selling album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine. Rolling Stone rated it at 493 of their 500 Greatest Albums of all Time, in May 2012. In the 2020 reboot of the list, its ranking was raised to #225.\nIn September 2022 the band released a variety of reissues of the album, including an 11-LP \"Super Deluxe\" version. This reissue won the Grammy for Best Historical Album.\n\n\n=== Down with Wilco, A Ghost Is Born, and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago ===\nWhile waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco agreed to support R.E.M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9\/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to \"create something good in the world right now\" and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay's Time of the Last Persecution, The Minus 5's Down with Wilco was released in 2003. Keyboardist Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down with Wilco, joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\n\nIn November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song \"Less Than You Think\", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called \"the track that everyone will hate\". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:\nI know ninety-nine percent of our fans won't like that song, they'll say it's a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don't want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it's valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn't have put it on the record if I didn't think it was great ... I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can't control it.\nLeroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple's website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to opioids. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. A Ghost Is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book, a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost Is Born. The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost Is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die. The new six-piece Wilco lineup, which has remained intact ever since, debuted on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago, a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from Spin, Billboard, and Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies.\n\n\n=== Sky Blue Sky ===\nWilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.\nWilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song \"What Light\" as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Inc. and Telef\u00f3nica M\u00f3viles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries.Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco \"shine[s] on a handful of the songs\" on Sky Blue Sky, such as the \"light, and straightforward\" songs. While he calls it a \"great traditional rock and folk album at times,...the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced.\" The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as \"deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to\" and noting its \"impeccable sound quality,\" the reviewer claimed that \"Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good.\"Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea, praised the album's \"breezy atmosphere and pacing,\" and noted that it is not \"easily judged upon first listen.\" Overall, Hernandez stated that it \"may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue.\" Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as \"one of the best albums of the year,\" calling it a \"timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class\" and \"a lean, mean, soulful album.\" Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording \"isn't groundbreaking,\" they praised its \"coherent musical expression\" and emphasis on \"solid songcraft without pretense\" which created a \"satisfying and melodically sound album.\"In anticipation of the 2008 US presidential election, Wilco released a downloadable version of Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released\" that they performed with Fleet Foxes. The MP3 was available as a free download from the band's website in exchange for a promise to vote in the election. The band also made an appearance on The Colbert Report to support presidential candidate Barack Obama. Wilco released a live performance DVD, Ashes of American Flags, on April 18, 2009, to celebrate Record Store Day.In December 2008, Jeff Tweedy, Pat Sansone, Glenn Kotche, and John Stirratt traveled to Auckland, New Zealand to participate in Neil Finn's 7 Worlds Collide sequel project, The Sun Came Out, joined by Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, Johnny Marr, KT Tunstall, Liam Finn, and Lisa Germano. They wrote and recorded several new tracks for the Oxfam-benefiting album including \"You Never Know,\" \"What Could Have Been,\" \"Over and Done,\" and \"Don't Forget Me.\" Jeff Tweedy co-wrote \"Too Blue\" with Johnny Marr, and Glenn, John, and Pat play on most tracks on the album.Having enjoyed their time in New Zealand and the vibe of Finn's own Roundhead Studios, the four members stayed in Auckland through January to record the foundation tracks for their next album. Jim Scott, who acted as engineer and mixer for the Neil Finn project, stayed on in the same capacity for the Wilco sessions. Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen would later add overdubs to these tracks at the band's Chicago Loft.\n\n\n=== Wilco (The Album) ===\nWilco released their seventh album, Wilco (The Album), on June 30, 2009. In March 2009, it was announced that singer-songwriter Feist would make a guest appearance on the new album, on the track \"You and I\". Like their previous three albums, Wilco streamed the entirety of the album on its website prior to release. The album hit the charts at a career-high No. 4 with sales of 99,000 on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart as well as the No. 2 spot on Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart. It marked Wilco's third top 10 album on the U.S. pop chart.  The album's first single \"You Never Know\" reached the No. 1 spot on the AAA Chart, their first No. 1 in twelve years.Beginning in April 2009, the band freely distributed a cover of Woody Guthrie's \"The Jolly Banker\", downloadable from their website. It was recorded at the Wilco loft in February of that year, at the suggestion of Guthrie's daughter, Nora. Downloaders were encouraged to donate to the Woody Guthrie Foundation. Feist returned to accompany on the track, playing the Garden Weasel. The track eventually became unavailable for download. In October 2011, the website began streaming the track via a plugin.On May 25, 2009, former band member Jay Bennett died in his home in Urbana, Illinois. In a prepared statement, Jeff Tweedy remarked that he was \"deeply saddened\" by Bennett's death.Feist and Wilco performed \"You and I\" on Late Show with David Letterman on July 14, 2009. In June during their West Coast tour, Wilco joined Beck, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson in the studio to take part in Beck's Record Club project, covering Skip Spence's Oar album. The first song \"Little Hands\" was posted on Beck's website on November 12, 2009.\nOn April 6, 2010, Wilco announced during their Boston performance that they would be headlining and curating a festival in North Adams, Massachusetts, dubbed Solid Sound Festival. The event ran at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art from August 13\u201315, and featured various Wilco side projects, including The Autumn Defense, Pronto, The Nels Cline Singers, and Jeff Tweedy solo. Other bands who appeared included Mavis Staples, Avi Buffalo, Outrageous Cherry, Richard Bishop, The Books, and Vetiver. It also featured non-musical media, such as the Bread and Puppet Theater and comedians Todd Barry, Kristen Schaal, John Mulaney, and Hannibal Buress as well as interactive musical installations by Cline and Kotche. In November 2016, the band also curates their own program during the tenth Anniversary Edition of Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, The Netherlands. This curated program includes performances by amongst others Tortoise, Bassekou Kouyat\u00e9, Lee Ranaldo, Fennesz, Steve Gunn, William Tyler and The Cairo Gang.\nWilco's contract with Nonesuch ended in 2010 and they formed their own label. Wilco announced via their web site and Twitter page on January 27, 2011 that the new label will be called dBpm Records (Decibels per Minute) and will be run out of the offices of their manager, Tony Margherita, in Easthampton, Massachusetts.\n\n\n=== The Whole Love ===\nWilco's eighth studio album, The Whole Love, was released on September 27, 2011. The first single of the album is titled \"Art of Almost\". The B-Side to \"I Might\" is a cover of Nick Lowe's 1977 song \"I Love My Label\". The single was shown at the Wilco's 2011 Solid Sound Festival at MassMoca and was met by positive reviews. The entire album was streamed live on Wilco's official website for 24 hours between September 3 and 4, 2011.\n\n\n=== Star Wars, Schmilco and \"All Lives, You Say?\" ===\nWilco's ninth studio album, Star Wars, was released on July 16, 2015, as a surprise free download. In October 2015, Wilco announced that they would embark on a US tour beginning in early 2016 in support of the album. In December 2015, Star Wars was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.On July 14, 2016, the band released a new single, titled \"Locator\", as a free download. Four days later, the band released another new single, titled \"If I Ever Was a Child\", and announced that their tenth album, Schmilco, would be released on September 9. Schmilco earned generally favourable reviews, earning a positive score of 79 on Metacritic, while reviewer Josh Modell called the album \"Wilco's most musically simple and emotionally resonant record in a decade.\"On Monday, August 14, 2017, Wilco released a single, \"All Lives You Say\" on their Bandcamp page to benefit the SPLC in memory of Tweedy's father Robert, who died on August 4. Upon sharing this news, Tweedy stated, \"My dad was named after a Civil War general, and he voted for Barack Obama twice. He used to say 'If you know better, you can do better.' America - we know better, we can do better.\"\n\n\n=== Ode to Joy ===\nWilco took 2018 off from touring while Glenn Kotche lived in Finland after his wife Miiri received a Fulbright scholarship. The band announced an end to their performing hiatus and the release of the album Ode to Joy on July 16, 2019. The album was released on October 4, 2019 and received generally positive reviews with Will Hermes of Rolling Stone calling it their \"best in years\" and delivers \"something like love shines through, and it winds up sounding joyful indeed, in a hard-won way.\" The album won the Grammy Award for best Special Limited Edition Package.Wilco subsequently followed the release with an autumn tour, the tour later being extended into 2020. In March 2020, Wilco and Sleater-Kinney announced that over the summer they would be embarking on the co-headlining It's Time Tour. Following cancellation of the tour in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wilco and Sleater-Kinney eventually rescheduled the tour for the summer of 2021. In October 2021, Wilco was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame for their multiple contributions to the live music series that airs on PBS.During the COVID-19 lockdown, the band released the single \"Tell Your Friends\" on Bandcamp on May 20, 2020, with all proceeds benefiting World Central Kitchen. In July 2020, as a voice to the larger cultural discussion and protests surrounding the murder of George Floyd, Tweedy announced that 5% of all his writer royalties would be donated to a program that distributes the funds to organizations fighting for racial justice, stating the modern music industry is \"built almost entirely on black art\" and that \"the wealth that rightfully belonged to black artists was stolen outright and to this day continues to grow outside their communities.\"\n\n\n=== Where are you, Jay Bennett? documentary ===\nIn 2021, a feature-length documentary on the life of Jay Bennett was released. The film focused heavily on Bennett's years with Wilco. Co-Directed by Gorman Bechard and Fred Uhter, this music documentary had its world premiere in Chicago in November 2021, then was released on Blu Ray and pay-per-view on April 19, 2022, and as part of a Record Store Day release with vinyl editions of Bennett's last two albums, Whatever Happened I Apologize and Kicking at the Perfumed Air on April 23, 2022.\"The new film does a wonderful job of capturing the quirkiness, inventiveness and brilliance of someone who never met an instrument he couldn't play. Bennett once described hearing the open spaces of the songs and holes that became his sonic landscape. They were at the core of the remarkable string of Wilco's albums Being There, Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"The film was originally started by Uhter, who asked the prolific Bechard to take over the project when it stalled. It takes a hard look at Bennett's treatment in the previous Wilco documentary, I Am Trying To Break Your Heart, which many consider to be unfair. \"Jay Bennett's reputation never quite recovered from the battering it took in Sam Jones' documentary I Am Trying To Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco, about the complex, lengthy gestation of 2002's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot in often painful detail, portrayed a band slowly pulling itself apart, with chief songwriters Bennett and Jeff Tweedy its twin opposing forces. The implication being that Bennett was a headstrong, intractable figure responsible for most of the discord. He was sacked as soon as the album was done. Filmmakers Gorman Bechard and Fred Uhter seek to redress the balance on Where Are You, Jay Bennett?\". The film painted a much more balanced picture of the relationship between Bennett and Tweedy. \"They just happened to be two egos at that point, fueled by a lot of demons. And it just wasn't working anymore,\" Bechard explained. \"They're both incredibly talented. They both had egos. They both, I think, saw maybe different paths for the band. And ultimately it was Jeff's band, so he's going to win that, and rightfully so. There were other issues, whether it be alcohol or drugs. You know, it was a little bit of everything. Personally, I wish they had stayed together because I think they could have literally become the next Lennon and McCartney or the next Jagger\/Richards.\"\n\n\n=== Cruel Country ===\nIn April 2022, the band announced their twelfth studio album, Cruel Country, which was released on May 27. The album was recorded entirely in person in live sessions at The Loft, the first album since 2007's Sky Blue Sky. Tweedy described the album as saying, \"We've never been particularly comfortable with accepting [...] the idea that I was making country music. But now, having been around the block a few times, we're finding it exhilarating to free ourselves within the form, and embrace the simple limitation of calling the music we're making country.\"\n\n\n=== Cousin ===\nIn August 2023, the band announced their thirteenth studio album, Cousin, which is scheduled to be released on September 29. It was produced by Welsh musician Cate Le Bon.\n\n\n== Musical style and influence ==\nWilco's music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career-long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. John Cale's Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, \"It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for\u2014that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?\"Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason & the Scorchers and the Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco's A.M.. Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs was dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis\u2014an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass's In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, and Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry.Some critics have dubbed Wilco the \"American Radiohead\", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a \"roots-rock ... [sound which] reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop.\"Rolling Stone described Wilco as \"one of America's most consistently interesting bands\" and \"America's foremost rock impressionists.\" Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon's Call), The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. Adam Grunduciel of The War on Drugs calls Wilco his \"Favorite modern day band.\" Other notable artists who have covered Wilco live include Norah Jones performing \"Jesus, Etc.\" which took place at the 2008 Bridge School Benefit where they both performed, a version of which was released as a bonus track on her 2009 release The Fall, Widespread Panic,  and Counting Crows and the Wallflowers performing \"California Stars.\"\n\n\n== Band members ==\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nA.M.

discography","categories":["Alternative rock discographies","Articles with short description","Discographies of American artists","Rock music group discographies","Short description with empty Wikidata description","Wilco"],"content":"The discography of the American alternative rock group Wilco, consists of twelve studio albums, five extended plays (EPs), three live albums, twelve singles and four videos. As of 2012 they had sold in excess of two million albums worldwide.\nFollowing the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, the band's first three studio albums were released on Reprise Records. During recording for the band's fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Reprise dropped the band from the label, causing outcry from media outlets such as the Chicago Tribune. The band signed with fellow Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Nonesuch Records in 2002, where the band has released all of its material since. Wilco recorded two albums of Woody Guthrie songs with Billy Bragg, and performed as a session band for The Minus 5 on their Down with Wilco album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was the most successful album for the band, earning a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\n\n\n== EPs ==\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== Compilations ==\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nThese songs have not appeared on an official album by Wilco, but several have appeared on their Alpha Mike Foxtrot: Rare Tracks 1994 - 2014 rarities collection. The song \"The T.B.

23, 2002, though released on their band\u2019s website on September 18, 2001. Recording sessions for the album began in late 2000. These sessions, which were documented for the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, were marred by conflicts including a switch in drummers and disagreements among the band members and engineers about songs. Despite this, the album would be completed in early 2001. The album showcased a more atmospheric and experimental sound than the band's previous work, and has been described as art rock and indie rock by music critics. It was the band's first album with drummer Glenn Kotche, and last with multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Jay Bennett.\nReprise Records, Wilco's record label at the time, refused to release the album as they felt unhappy about the end result; this would lead to Wilco's departure from Reprise. The band subsequently acquired the rights to the album and later streamed the entire album for free on their website on September 18, 2001. In November of that year, Wilco signed with Nonesuch Records, who gave the album its first official retail release on April 23, 2002. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot received widespread acclaim from music critics at release, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 2000s. It is also Wilco's best-selling work, having reached number 13 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\n\n== Background and recording ==\n\nWilco was touring to promote Mermaid Avenue Vol. II in May 2000 when lead singer Jeff Tweedy was invited to play at the Noise Pop Festival in Chicago. The festival promoter offered to pair Tweedy with a collaborator of his choosing, and Tweedy decided to perform with Jim O'Rourke. Tweedy frequently played O'Rourke's album Bad Timing in his car while he traveled during the previous winter. O'Rourke was an accomplished producer as well as a musician, and had produced over 200 albums by the time that Tweedy requested the collaboration. O'Rourke offered the services of drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio performed at Double Door for the festival on May 14, 2000. Tweedy enjoyed the performance so much that he suggested that the trio record an album together. They chose the name Loose Fur, and recorded six songs during the following summer.By the end of the year, Wilco had recorded enough demo tracks to release a fourth studio album (the working title was Here Comes Everybody), but the band was unhappy with some of the takes of the songs. This was attributed to the inflexibility of Ken Coomer's drumming. According to American Songwriter, \"virtually every attempt [Tweedy] made to steer Coomer toward the percussive sound he had envisioned for the record sparked a fight.\" The band decided to bring Kotche into the studio to record with the band. Wilco officially replaced Coomer with Kotche in January 2001, a decision originally proposed by Tweedy and almost immediately approved by the rest of the band.\nGuitarist Jay Bennett and Chris Brickley served as the audio engineers, and agreed with Tweedy that O'Rourke would be a good choice to mix the album, after a failed attempt to mix a few of the songs at the Chicago Recording Company and after hearing O'Rourke's \"audition mix\". One of the conflicts, exhibited in the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco, was over the ten-second transition between \"Ashes of American Flags\" and \"Heavy Metal Drummer\". Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition, each of which would yield slightly different results, but Tweedy explained that he just wanted the problem fixed, and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches. Bennett focused on the individual songs, while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issues\u2014a tried and true division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co-wrote the material.In order to achieve the band's musical goals, Tweedy invited Jim O'Rourke into the studio to mix \"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\", and the results impressed the band members. Jim O'Rourke was officially in Wilco from that point. He recorded 6 of the 12 tracks on the album. O'Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album. After the album's completion, Tweedy decided to remove Bennett from the band. The album was completed in 2001, and Tweedy believed it to be ready for release. The album was given the title Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, referencing a series of letters in the phonetic alphabet that Tweedy had heard on the Irdial box set The Conet Project: Recordings of Shortwave Numbers Stations. A clip from this Numbers Station transmission was placed in the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot song \"Poor Places\"; Irdial later sued Wilco for copyright infringement, and a settlement was reached out of court. The cover of the album is a picture of the two Marina City complex towers in the band's adopted hometown of Chicago.\nLos Angeles photographer Sam Jones contacted Wilco in 2000 about producing a documentary film about the creation of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco beginning on the day that Coomer was dismissed from the band. The footage was edited down to 92 minutes, and the film was released to theaters in 2002. The documentary has received generally positive reviews.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Original release ===\nIn 2001, AOL merged with Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Time Warner's market share of the music industry had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label. Klein's dismissal placed head A&R representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Kahne assigned A&R representative Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of the album. Vukovic was unhappy about the album because he felt that his suggestions were not being considered. Kahne wanted a radio single from the album, but he felt that none of the songs were suitable for commercial release. In June 2001, the album was officially rejected and Vukovic suggested that the band independently release the album.Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, was able to negotiate a buy-out of the band from Reprise. The band would keep the rights to the album if they paid Reprise $50,000. Before Wilco could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free. Despite Reprise's efforts to accommodate Wilco's departure, the process marred public relations after an article in the Chicago Tribune described what had happened.Wilco had planned on releasing Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy did not want a change in record labels to significantly delay the release of the album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album.\n\n\n=== Retail release ===\nBoth major and independent record labels made bids to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records. Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that he liked. He also decided to ignore small, independent labels because he wanted to be able to put the album out for a large audience and felt that very small labels would be unable to produce more than 100,000 copies. Wilco decided to sign with Warner Music subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001, basing the decision on the label's affiliation with a large company, but also Nonesuch's artist-friendly atmosphere. In the end, Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise Records (a Warner label), received the rights to the album from Reprise for free, and then had it released by a different Warner label, Nonesuch Records.The More Like the Moon EP (also called Bridge and Australian EP) was originally released as a bonus disc to the Australian version of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. The EP comprised six songs that were recorded but not released during the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sessions including a re-working of \"Kamera\". On the one-year anniversary of the release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco uploaded the EP onto their official website, and offered it for free to anyone who purchased the album. The band would later allow anyone to download the EP for free off the website, regardless of whether they had purchased the full-length album.\n\n\n=== 20th anniversary reissue ===\nIn celebration of the 20th anniversary of the album's release, Wilco performed the album in its entirety for four nights at the United Palace in New York City and three nights at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago. The band was joined by strings and horns sections in an attempt to perform the album as it was recorded. The band also announced reissues of the album, including a Super Deluxe version spanning 11 LPs which includes the original remastered album, demos, rare live recordings, and other alternate versions of the songs. These reissues were released on September 30, 2022. Pitchfork gave the reissue a perfect 10 rating, and naming it \"Best New Reissue\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical ===\nYankee Hotel Foxtrot was acclaimed by critics upon release. Brent Sirota of Pitchfork gave the album a perfect 10 rating, noting that the album was \"simply a masterpiece.\" David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised its resemblance to psychedelia while Allmusic writer Zac Johnson lauded its musical \"complexity\". E! Online said that its \"rich, exotic flavor gets more intense the longer you chew on it\", while Stylus Magazine called it \"a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start.\" Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it \"a more adventurous and rewarding release\". The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that \"After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- it becomes clear that these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant.\" Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it \"The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world ... ever? Could be ...\" Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, \"The most common description of this much-discussed album over the past few months is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that.\" Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: \"Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi.\" Q likewise gave it four stars and called it \"battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts\" and that it \"at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating.\" Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, \"Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke.\"Trouser Press was one of the few major media outlets that did not give the album a good review, instead giving it an average review and stating that \"more time spent in the songwriting lab might have yielded material more suitable to the evident studio effort invested and brought Wilco closer to making a truly great album.\" Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention rating, describing the music as \"purty\" but stating that he found the lyrics and vocals in general to be boring.Though Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was recorded before the September 11, 2001 attacks, critics perceived references in the album to the attacks. For example, Jeff Gordinier of Entertainment Weekly compared the two towers of Marina City to the World Trade Center towers. Also containing similar themes are the songs \"War on War\" and \"Ashes of American Flags\" which contains the line \"I would like to salute the ashes of American flags.\" The song \"Jesus, Etc.\" also contains these lyrics:\n\"Tall buildings shake, Voices escape singing sad sad songs ... Voices whine, Skyscrapers are scraping together, your voice is smoking.\"\n\n\n=== Commercial ===\nYankee Hotel Foxtrot was released by Nonesuch on April 23, 2002. The album sold 55,573 copies during its first week of release, peaking on the US Billboard 200 album chart at number 13. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over 590,000 units.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nYankee Hotel Foxtrot was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll. In 2008, Rolling Stone critic Tom Moon listed Yankee Hotel Foxtrot among the 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die.  The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.Yankee Hotel Foxtrot found a place on many lists of the greatest albums of the 2000s. Rolling Stone ranked the album at number three on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the Decade. Pitchfork put the album at number four on the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s. The alternative music website also named \"Poor Places\" and \"Jesus, Etc.\" as the 147th and 61st best songs of the decade, respectively. Paste named the album the second-best album of the decade. Some music outlets have ranked Yankee Hotel Foxtrot as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2006, readers of Q Magazine voted it the 100th \"Greatest Album Ever\".
